"Ok guys... At this point, just let pals no-clip through everything at the base so they can reach the machines, they already do it half the time anyway. Things that used to be reachable, are now unreachable. Somehow it's worse than day 1, it really kills the experience.

"It feels like cheap copyright theft. I don't like it. I don't understand why it's so popular but it's all scuffed. The lag and desync is horrific. The ""AI"" is scuffed. it's like lipstick on a pig with a grind fest for pal improvement. The combat is really bad, the base building is insanely basic. There is no homogeneous theme to the art style across the assets, pals, character, world etc. You put down like a Victorian cabinet next to a 90's high school locker. Going back to AI...scuffed is too nice. It's really stinking bad. The pal copies your movement, you can't command them to fight, you have no control and the enemy AI just sort of stands there, aware of nothing and dies.","Technical Stability, AI Quality, Art Style Consistency"

"Palworld, an innovative and immersive gaming experience, offers several compelling reasons to dive into its world. Firstly, its unique blend of elements from the popular ""creature-collecting"" genre and the sandbox survival genre provides players with a refreshing and dynamic gameplay experience. The ability to capture and train adorable creatures known as ""Pals,"" each with their own distinct abilities and traits, adds depth and strategy to the game. Additionally, the game's emphasis on building and crafting within a vibrant open-world environment encourages creativity and exploration. Furthermore, the incorporation of multiplayer features allows for cooperative play with friends, fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. With its charming graphics, engaging gameplay mechanics, and multiplayer options, Palworld offers an exciting and enjoyable gaming experience for players of all ages.","Gameplay Innovation, Creative Building, Multiplayer Features"

"A survival crafting game where you catch pocket monsters called Pals and explore Palpago islands. As off now there is no real objective other than catching all the different kinds of pals, fight the 6 bosses of the game, and battle 3 different raid pals and lastly explore an oil rig floating on the sea.

Graphics - 10/10 (Game is too laggy for my pc but I am willing to do a pc upgrade to play at better fps
Pocket Monster originality with their designs - 9/10 (Every creature is carefully designed from animals or things and even culture from in real life! It is missing a point because of 2 humanoid pals that keeps on bullying me or the pal I want to catch)
Music - 7/10 (Not enough music in this game, devs please add some biome and environment music instead of just battle music)
Sounds and effects - 10/10 (Cute pals gives bonus points to me, especially Flambelle sounds)

Overall score to the game - 8/10 (Still missing a few things like overworld music and there is no Flambelle Noct/Aqua as of now)

Devs please add Flambelle Noct/Aqua and maybe more subspecies instead of just 1. Flambelles can have noct and aqua, Dazzis can have a water or rain varriant, Daedream can have a normal varriant, We need more cute/kawaii pals in the game but out of all the new or subspecies of cute pals I want to see is Flambelle Noct/Aqua.","Graphics and Performance, Design Originality, Audio Quality"

"Monster Collecting + Base Building + Crafting + Survival + 3rd Person Shooter

This should be how this game is described as, not 'Pokemon with Guns'. This game plays nothing like Pokemon, and really the similarities end with the monster collecting. (Let's overlook the design similarities as that's a whole other argument...) You run around the world whacking away at pals and environment alike to get resources together to build your base and raise your army of slav... i mean pals! You then have your pals do the mundane chores around your base like gathering, cooking, item creation, etc. As you level up and unlock new technologies, you will grow out your base in not only size and function, but also aesthetic looks. But do be careful, for one of the several npc factions might decide to raid your base for funzies. So after you've set up and defended your base, you can finally step back out into the world to find more pals to enslav.. befriend and uncover dungeons to explore and conquer. All this prepares you for the boss tower fights, which is essentially the current end game 'raid' fights.

There's so much more to get into or go over that this review could go on and on. As this is in early access, there are a lot of things that need polishing. I hope the story is expanded upon, maybe see some more cool cut scenes, and the developers holding up their timeline for updates. This game is diamond in the rough that has already captivated millions of players, just imagine what it'll do once it is fully polished.","Genre Accuracy, Gameplay Loop"

"""Pokemon but with guns.""
It's... no lie, but the statement falls criminally short of everything this game offers. For a game that is still incomplete there is an incredible amount of content to sink your teeth into and the degree of polish is pretty damned impressive.
Regarding the polish - yes, there ARE bugs - but the worst bug I encountered clipped me through the ground and I had to do a quick restart to fix it. That's not a complaint. Literally, quit to main menu, go back in. 15 seconds, done. Fixed. And lost nothing in the process. While not perfect, it puts most triple-A titles to shame.
As for the content.... The most obvious is collecting the pals, which is more important than one might expect as it's the best way to gain experience and having extras on hand will be important for maintaining and defending your base which is a HUGE help with resource collection.
Speaking of bases, there's that. As you level up you'll unlock more functions to your base, be able to build it out of different materials, and it's entirely customizable - a simple hovel or a towering fortress, create it how you please. Admittedly, tile placement can be a little wonky - with roof tiles wanting to connect to floor tiles more easily than the tops of walls - still, it's not irredeemably bad.
Naturally, there's combat as well, which is great. For weakening the pals in preparation to catch them you'll want to use melee with is notably weaker than ranged attacks - I'm not sure if that was intentional, but if you're higher level trying to catch weaker pals it is a priceless asset. Additionally, you have human enemies and fight them directly - seriously your base will occasionally get attacked by humans of the enemy factions and they are there to KILL you. So none of that ""blacked out"" or ""fainting"" bullshit. While the game is obviously not geared towards kids, it's inspiration doesn't seem to realize that it's main audience have grown up and are adults now. It's nice to have a game that doesn't condescend with thinly veiled double-speak.
Lastly is crafting, it's easy if not the quickest - all the resources you have on based are considered in your inventory, so you don't have to worry about pulling things out of chests to build... whatever. It's a very nice QoL choice on the part of the devs.

Now, what could be done better? A lot. There are still things that it's faster/easier to farm offsite, which isn't a bad thing in its own right, but moving while over your carry weight is annoyingly slow. I get the /why/ but but ""realism"" shouldn't take precedence over fun; now I wouldn't ask that it be completely removed, but having one of your pals on standby with a cart that'll haul things between wherever you are and your base, or the larger ride-able pals being unaffected by however much you're carrying would be a godsend. Similarly, flying pals you can ride are really slow and the stamina use with it is extremely limiting. Lastly, apart from the obvious inspirations, there are a disturbing number of pals that are mere reskins of each other - which with less than 150, is pretty awful. I'd love to see to some of the reskinned beasts be flat-out replaced; and while I wouldn't want a thousand plus, another 50-100 would be nice.

That all said, this game is still only ~60% complete and is damned good as it is; so I am VERY hopeful for the future of this game and wish it and the people creating this absolute gem nothing but the best.

"Amazing game but has some serious issues the developers need to fix.

Randomly resets progress (was able to reload from a backup but still lost 8 hours of progress)

Pal AI and pathing are completely broken. Assigning Pals to a task is super buggy (will say no work available when throwing them directly at something)

Pals will fall under the map and get stuck in rocks and then starve and get injuries.

Pals will leave their assigned task randomly especially after sleeping. I literally had to destroy my stone pit and tree farm as well as place objects over every tree/rock spawn location in order to get them to breed because they would just run off midway and do whatever they wanted.

There is also a bug when throwing spheres on a mount that causes the spheres to get stuck in your hand and you cannot change to another tool/weapon and this can be used to infinitely dupe spheres because it will still throw them after it hits 0.

Biggest issue is the memory leaks on multiplayer servers causing hosted dedicated servers to crash constantly.

Also needs PvP and more endgame content but those are on the developer road map.

The game is really fun to play and has a ton of potential. I will change my review to positive when these issues are addressed.","Technical Stability, AI Functionality, Progression Reliability"

"This game brings a nice mashup of addictive gameplay loops from other popular games. You can't go wrong with it, it's dopamine followed by more dopamine.

There are a lot of bugs, but it's early access so it's to be expected.

Edit:
The dopamine went away, the gameplay became repetitive, and the grind to level up was too long.
A good way to fix this is to increase player XP gain by default so the game can be beat in around 30hrs or so.
If you're gonna play it, I highly recommend cranking up XP on world creation, or else you may get bored before getting to the game's end.","Gameplay Loop, Technical Stability, Progression Grind"

Well I was wrong.

Palworld is one of the best games I have ever played. It is one of those games that has taken all the best features from all the other games on the market and combined them into one super mega game!

Do you like Pokemon? Palworld Has it.
Do you like Elden Ring? Palworld's Gotcha!
Do you like Breath of the Wild? Palworld's Seen You!
Do you like Ark or Survival Games? Get Palworld Baby!

It feels like the dev's have taken all the elements from all the best game and combined them into one great open world exploration and crafting game. The world design and the dungeons (Gaols) have been taken from Elden Ring. The exploration from Breath of the Wild combined with Torrent from Elden Ring. They've thrown it all together and added whats essentially Pokemon. Finally add the ability to put these little creatures to work, farm them, eat them, tame them, love them all within your crafted base!

- The best way to level is by catching Pals. Make a shield and glider as soon as possible.
- There are 9 types: Normal, Grass, Water, Fire, Ground, Electric, Ice, Dark, and Dragon. Try to find pals with 2 types to get full type coverage.
- Get a Vixy and put it in a Ranch. They will dig up Pal Spheres, Arrows, and Gold Coins.
- Rideable Pals are very strong. You can swap out their abilities in the Party menu. Pals never forget an ability once it is learned.
- There are base locations around the map with multiple ore veins. Build your second base around the veins and put in a bunch of Pals that can mine.
- You can still use the grappling hook and fast travel while overburdened. Use these if you need to move large amounts of resources.
- The max level is 50, so save your Technology points for things that won’t quickly become obsolete.
- Late game metals take forever to make, but you can speed it up by using Pals with higher levels of Kindling.
- Quartz is in the Pristine Snow Field on the West side of the Northernmost island. Bring a fire Pal to keep you warm.","Beginner Gameplay Tips, Pal Management, Base Building Strategies"

"[h1]Palworld – Cute Pals, Questionable Ethics, and Total Mayhem[/h1]

""Palworld"" is like Pokémon took a detour through a dystopian survival game and came out with a serious case of dark humor. You collect adorable Pals, but things go off the rails fast when you realize those fluffy friends can be used for everything—from running your sweatshop to acting as your personal meat shield in battle. Oh, and anything inside a Pal Ball? Yeah, technically a ""Pal,"" even humans. Let the chaos begin. 😈🎯

[h2]Pros:[/h2]

Pals are adorable... until you start using them as mobile power plants or cannon fodder. 🐾🔫
A wild variety of gameplay: farming, fighting, factory work, or just casually shooting at your own Pals for fun. 🌾💼💥
Dark humor everywhere—like when you realize you can “accidentally” shoot a Pal (or a ""Pal"" that's suspiciously human) and still sleep at night. 🤷‍♂️😬
I’m having an absolute blast with all the chaos. It’s weird, wild, and totally addictive! 🎉🔥

[h2]Cons:[/h2]

Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of all the mayhem. Is that a farm or a battlefield? Who knows anymore. 😵‍💫


If you love cute creatures, dark humor, and the occasional ""oops, I just shot my Pal,"" then ""Palworld"" is the game for you. It’s not just about collecting Pals—it’s about seeing how far you can push the moral envelope while laughing at the absurdity. I’m having way too much fun with it. 😏💣","Questionable Ethics, Gameplay Variety, Dark Humor"
"Just awesome.  Really fun, plus you can basically set up the game to your style of play without losing achievements or missing out on anything.
It runs a little bleh on my computer but my computer is a bit older anyways.
Graphics are fine.
I wish there was weather.  You can hear wind and trees sometimes, people say the cold place has snow flurries.  But there is no actual weather in the game.  It'd be nice if there was rain.  I'd prefer it didn't change the game but I know people would want it so that it effects elemental attacks i.e. raining would make water palmon more powerful or a big storm would be how a huge, unique water/electric palmon spawns, etc.  It would still be cool.
I would also like it if the character looked more alive and less like a stock image.  You don't close your eyes to sleep.  Your character makes no facial expressions for the most part.  Little things like that are important to me.  But the core game play is great.  The way you can actually tailor them to suit your gaming style is also a huge plus.
Some more explanations would be really nice, too.  I just started the game up yesterday after years of not playing (personal reasons, not because of the game) and suddenly there's Dog coins, junk and stuff with Terraria (that I am REALLY looking forward to) but I am not told how to get dog coins or junk.  It's a bit frustrating and since the game doesn't pause, alt+tabbing is not always an option.

But it is a really solid game and the most fun I have had in a long time.  It's a great escape from reality, that I seriously needed.","Gameplay Fun, Technical Performance, Visual Features"
"For an early access title with supposedly high recommended specs it runs pretty well on a more average computer. Game looks great, the premise of Ark x Pokémon x Zelda is, in my opinion, fantastic. I really enjoy the base building and working with my Pals to further the skill tree. If you like any of the games mentioned above I'd heartily recommend giving this a go.

"I got to make a sub-par work table with my normal sheep and ghost sheep as a group project, together. We made the crappiest table ever, but you know what? It's the best freaking table I've made.

I gotta say, I was scared to play this. Why? I'm sensitive to others' safety, even if they aren't real. Gotta say, that the one thing I'm happiest for, that's really minute and small, is the absence of blood and gore. I played Doom Eternal, and had zero issue, but I'd have a significantly harder time killing a cat- one that looks cute too-  than most rage games. So I have to say thank you for the absence of excessive gore.

"Very great game loop. I'd like to address some issues that I've noticed, and we have worked around.

Common issue 1: You always need ingots
While that's true, there are ways to make all the surplus ingots that you'll need.
We have a partially automated mining/smelting base. the only thing we have to do, is occasionally go and put ingots in a furnace to smelt. 
It doesn't matter what chests the mons put the ore in, because you will pull from all of them. Never worry about finding materials, as when you craft, it looks through all chest. (Amazing feature that I wish Ark had)

We have our main base, where we craft our weapons, spheres, etc
A metal/coal base (Look around, you'll find locations), where we get all of our ingots, 
and a farm base. 
We have 2 berry farms at each, and profit in berries, and a few others like tomato and wheat at our farm/breeding base. 

**Engineer around your issues, this isn't Pokemon. **

Commons Issue 2: There's so many bugs, and jank!
There's a little jank in some things, but it's been out in early access for a week... give it some time. For the most part, the bugs aren't game breaking. On dedicated server, I did have where I got stuck in opening a cage animation, but that was it in all 70 hours of gameplay. The other things are like, mons looking like they are walking backwards, or upside down. 
There are also some really funny ones, like where you can catch the bosses, or use the police force to fight for you (The police force following you all over is fixed by relogging) 

Modding! Modding is expected to be officially supported. And when that happens, most of, if not all of these issues will be resolved by modders. 


Long review longer -- If you enjoy the game loop of, gather, craft, build, fight, repeat. You'll love this. If you're looking for something earth shattering, you won't find it here. It's got a very fun game loop, and is nice to relax with. Again, it's not Pokemon. The game loop is different, don't expect something it's not.

"Even after taking a break from this game at launch. Playing this game again after multiple updates and it's still fun to play. Palworld has almost everything I wanted from Pokemon. All the pals in this game have incredible animations to show each of their own quirks and character. Having a base pal like Lullu in the base and it spins when helping you build is amusing to look at. 

New quality of life updates such as making bigger pals not get stuck and no longer needing to hold F thanks to a new toggle button help make the game more enjoyable even now.

The game is still in early access but I am very much looking forward to the final version once it releases.","Gameplay Enjoyment, Animation Quality, Quality of Life Updates"
this game is quiet interesting and unique in some perspective. i tried rust.it was not bad. i have played pokemon also. its a mixture of this two. and the dev made it in the best possible way. i was intrigued of its hyped since its release. after getting my hand on this game. i realised how addictive and wonderful game this is,"Uniqueness, Developer Execution, Addictiveness"

"It needs a lot of work. It's playable and fun, but it's a buggy mess. My recommendation is get it in a few months, mods will come out and give you a better experience.

If you leave a guild/change leaders, all other offline guild members will become corrupt. You will often fall through the world. A lot of the gameplay also depends on what server you join because lag can make or break a battle.

"So I'll start this by saying I am an AVID survival/building game lover. This game gives you a lot to work with. The building could use some work but its still quite easy to work with. Pieces line up nicely but it's lacking the small detailed parts all builders love and use. The single player is a ton of fun and progression is fun and doesn't feel like a grind even though it absolutely is. The Pals all have their own personality traits which really does make a difference as you progress. I have put 60 hours in since release day and can say without a doubt this has very quickly become a favourite. I will add that most of the Favorited host companies have this game, but be weary as some of them appear to currently be having some really bad lag issues which makes the game just about unplayable.","Building Mechanics, Progression Experience, Multiplayer Stability"

"Yeah, I feel like my game time isn't enough to fully experience the game, but I really wanted to share my opinion. At the end of the day, all we want is a game that is fun and engaging, and I think this game achieves that. Despite the current issues it's facing (being labeled a Pokemon clone, bugs, early access, etc.), we can see that the development team is passionate about what they're doing. Perhaps they're also fans of Pokemon who grew tired of the franchise sticking with the same old gameplay mechanics. Playing this game brings back memories of when I first played Pokemon on my Gameboy.

Edit: Need to update this for the badge lol. The game continues to release updates despite the fact that they are currently facing legal issues with **** and I hope they win this fight.","Fun and Engagement, Developer Passion, Nostalgic Appeal"

"Does this game have a clearly derived gameplay style?  Art style?  Does it completely reinvent the wheel in the best possible way? Nope, not at all.

Neither does a fat, juicy bacon cheeseburger and a pint of beer.

Both the game and the meal may not be the most ""original"" thing you've ever had, but I'll be damned if they both don't take a lot of what you love and mash them together in one hell of a package.  Palworld activates neurons and the creators treat the playerbase right, and while that might not seem like ALL that, I guess it's more of an indictment of the industry at large that something that really doesn't seem like it SHOULD be one of the best games of the year, IS one of the best games of the year simply because the developers give the players what they want and don't treat the players like children and/or money cows.

It doesn't have to try and be the next cutting-edge, complex, ground-breaking thing in order to make its customers happy.  It just has to be a damn good ""cheeseburger"" - and it has that in spades.","Execution of Familiar Elements, Player Engagement, Developer Respect"

"This is genuinely good, like many others I bought this after they showed you can capture humans however unlocking the crafting/technologies in order to get to the guns/good stuff has also been fun on it's own. One thing I've noticed at my camp is some monsters will get stuck on the border of the base area because of a ledge. When they get hungry, they just stay there stuck and hungry. It won't allow me to pick them up sometimes too, but I just go return them to storage and put them back to camp which fixes it just fine.
It's pretty open sandbox and you can fast travel to a small handful of locations off the bat, however you'd be facing quite the challenge at some of them if you go unprepared/underleveled. There are fast travel locations to unlock that make filling out your collection easy as well as when you need to get back to base. I built my base by the beginning fast travel point so it's pretty convenient coming back after a long travel.
Only lv11 so far, but I think I'll definitely continue and hope the devs keep up the great work.","Gameplay Loop, Technical Stability, Sandbox Freedom"

"This game make everyone see that twitter or any other BS its not the real world, its a game, a vitual world ethics do not mater in a virtual world, make a fun game that its fun to play and people will play it.
+ For some reason people only care about ethics on twitter on some games, i mean pokemon its already slavary + dog fight, in a lot of action game u kill a lot of civilians, ark its animal cruelty with less cute creatures.

Pros:
- Insanaly fun to play and an incredible game loop (a bit slow if u dont increase the xp multiplier in solo)
- No performance issues (at least for me), for modern games and for a game in this early state of the early acces its a huge win
- Incredible good base for the game, you have to fkup really hard to makee the game worse in future updates
- Finally someone who know about law and know that because an intelectual property (pokemon, ark...) its dominant on certain genre/art style they do not own the right to it, and nintendo had been trying to make the world think that they own the creaturee catcher style or the cute creatures in that cartoon art style when they do not own it. (also nintendo didnt invent the creature catcher genre)
- Good progresion line for this stage of the early access, normally in this stage of early access you get frustrated because u can see clearly that something is missing in the progression of the game but its not the case on this one.

Cons:
- Its an early stage of an early access, expect bugs and core parts (history for example) missing
- Its missing core options on world customization, like stat increase multipliers for player, pals and captured pals so u can adapt the difficulty of the game to you
- There is some serious bugs with the Pals working in base, specially if u have a base with verticality, pals do not know what to do
- Its missing a structure/way to make pals do things in a priority order. Example: ""If there is something to craft priorize that, then priorize build, then priorize harvest, then priorize mining"". This way would be easier to automatizate the base
- Its missing (or at least i do not know a way) to move huge quantity of materials from base to base, im missing a Pal that have inventory, like an special upgrade for one of the big Pals like the green pal that increase the weight u can have that make that Pal a walking chest with weight limit of 6-10k, make that Pal be the worst in combat by far but have that utility
- The rest of cons i have are mainly bugs but its an early access so they are not really cons (raid bugs, some pals getting hard stuck)

Hard Pro:
- Twitter hate it","Virtual Ethics, Gameplay Loop, Technical Stability"

The one thing I wish this game had was a way to move things you built for your garrison into new locations without having to deconstruct it.

This game is great solo, I haven't tried multiplayer yet but I am sure some of my buds will snag it and we will try shortly. Worth the price.","Gameplay Loop, Solo Experience, Consumer Value"

"It's like ark: survival evolved but instead of dinosaurs it's a parody of pokemon. It's also WAAY less janky than ark was at any point. It also delves into a lot of the fucked up aspects of a realistic pokemon society that the pokemon franchise usually just pretends doesn't exist. Need to catch your first pal but you don't have one to battle for you? Beat the shit out of one and stuff it into a ball. Need to eat something but there are no normal animals? Kill and eat the pals.

All in all, it's a fun, and at times, cute game you can play with your friends.","Technical Stability, Thematic Depth, Co-op Enjoyment"

"I don't usually write reviews, but for Palworld, I might just have to. Honestly,  and gameplay loop is pretty good if you live survival style games, overall not amazing but fine for an Early Access and for the price point.
The main reason I had to refund is due to the dedicated multiplayer servers are almost unplayable. I will get booted every 20-30 minutes, and will get random errors when server lists are refreshing. Now, the worst part is that my progression/save in the dedicated 32-player servers upon restart is lost, and I have to start from zero and go all the way back to the character creation screen. The local server/single player mode works fine though, aside from the in-game bugs  and what not.
Also, the optimization could use a lot of work. Too much noticeable pop-ins even on the highest graphical setting on my RTX 4090. Also performance could be better, DLSS helps with this by quite a bit. And finally, wehave to talk about the art assets. For the most part, the visuals are okay. The environments are a bit bland/empty, and low quality textures. Also some of the asset's LODs (specifically the trees are a bit jarring).

I hope they can work out the dedicated servers soon, so I could repurchase again when the game has better dedicated servers. Aside from some technical and graphical flaws, the gameplay is pretty decent.","Gameplay Loop, Multiplayer Stability, Technical Optimization"

"to some extent the bosses seem a little pointless especially after you have beaten a few of them since they all give the same tech points which feels a lot more shallow than the bosses in ark and you can easily skip like half or more of the bosses, also having so many bosses almost shoots itself in the foot especially since they arent that hard... it sort of feels a little like doing the same thing over and over for like tons of bosses that have no real significance or special challenge/special abilities that you would ever even notice in the fight- the AI is pretty janky which makes a lot of bosses easier, the difficulty scaling feels pretty weird as that most enemies arent that hard to dodge and you can pod your pal at 1hp and it regens during the fight while you can still fight with the 4 others so you can essentially kill them while underleveled by a long way but actually catching them is quite hard unless you have the right tier of spheres

the game is pretty fun, the breeding is pretty addicting and trying to get all the best stats on strong pals feels rewarding but also would take forever on official settings, you basically need to set the eggs to hatch faster if you ever wanna have top stats on multiple lines... its frustrating that if you have a perfect breeding pair their children can still be born with like 1/4 good traits but otherwise fairly solid 

overall I would say palworld does a great job of combining the aspects of games like pokemon, ark, and genshin (to a lesser degree than the other two), the difficulty is overall medium to low depending what path you choose, theres many options for how you progress, but quite a few things feel a little bit shallow or meaningless, when there is so much content it still seems fun but a lot of pals are practically exactly the same as eachother in what they can do.

"I'm enjoying this game a lot. It's for everyone who likes collecting creatures, building a base and shooting at enemies. Even in early access there's a lot to discover and stuff feels already solid.

The bugs are mostly around the Pals in ur base, so get stuck or don't do the tasks they're supposed to do, but just putting them back into the Pal-Box and then back to your base, fixes most of the bugs. Just make sure the square shown while building the Pal-Box is free space, cuz that's where your pals spawn if u get them into ur base.","Gameplay Loop, Technical Stability"

At first I was skeptical. Not a huge fan of Ark-type games. While the aesthetic here is obviously Poke'mon, the gameplay itself feels much more survival / Ark style to me, minus the obvious addition of catching Pals. That aspect itself completely changes the feel. Being able to deploy Pals for labor in your base makes the advancement grind far less tedious, and actually enjoyable. The interplay between these two aspects is very well balanced. You want to explore to find new Pals. You want new Pals to help build your base. You want to build your base to improve your exploration experience / gear. It's honestly a pretty addicting cycle. Still a lot of bugs in Early Access of course, but overall runs pretty smooth for me. Playing with a friend in Coop mode makes for an even better experience.","Gameplay Loop, Technical Stability, Cooperative Play"

"I don't often write reviews for games but this game is the exception. This game is the good parts of both Ark and Pokemon. I was never a big fan of Ark with how much grinding is required with me being a casual gamer, and Pokemon never had that open world adventure until Legends Arceus and Paldea and yet its still sorta restrictive. Palworld combines the open world freedom of Ark and the mechanics of Pokemon. The grind is not that difficult compared to what Ark was. Personally to a casual like me this game is a 10/10 for being just released and I can't wait for what they do to further improve this game.","Casual Accessibility, Open World Freedom, Genre Hybrid Mechanics"

Palworld is a mishmash of ideas from other games, and that, could be fine. But it seriously lacks any kind of uniqueness in the gameplay department, and it's overall amateurish UE5 look doesn't do it any favors.
The gameplay revolves around grinding resources to grind even more resources, and the combat really suffers from it. Music and sound design is bland.

### Gameplay

This game is fairly similar to Ark. In both games, you arrive on a set of islands and you're expected to survive. When you level, you gain points to increase some attributes. You need to build shelter to survive. You need to hunt or gather food to eat. You need to cook that food too. Palworld doesn't make use of dehydration, thankfully.
Likewise, you're expected to catch/tame Pals/Dinosaurs to make life easier. In Palworld, every Pal has a set variety of tasks they can perform. This can range from gardening, hauling, kindling, handiwork, etc. Each Pal has a set proficiency in that task. For example, the cute fire fox you saw in the beginning of the game is probably far less efficient than the giant fire dragon you find later in the game. Maximizing efficiency is beneficial but not particularly required, depending on your playstyle and who you're playing with.

On the combat side, there are two factors: You and your summoned Pal. Like Pokemon, each Pal has a type. Some Pals can have two types. This seems to influence the element(s) they're weak/strong against but I'm not entirely sure if it affects damage, similar to Pokemon's same-type attack bonus. I also suspect Pals have a hidden typing that isn't displayed, as it's odd that a Dark type can learn Ice, Fire, and Normal moves in addition to Dark.
Each Pal has 3 active abilities that can be swapped out at any time. There are also Berries you can find to teach new attacks. Once summoned, a Pal will remain close to you. If summoned into combat, it will begin attacking with its skills. If in a base, the Pal will seek out work to do if not directly assigned or simply idle around if there's nothing to do.

As for the player, you have 4 weapon slots. As you progress through the game, you'll gradually upgrade in tech level. From a primitive club, to a stone spear, to a triple shot bow, all the way up to.... a fucking Assault Rifle. Yes, this game has guns. You'll also need to make bullets. 
In addition to weapons, you have 2 armor slots - one for head armor and the other for body. You have a shield slot, glider slot, and 2 accessory slots. All of these will upgrade with tech level aside from accessories. Those are bought from merchants or dropped from Alpha Pals/random chests.

Overall, I don't mind the gameplay loop. Except for...

### The Problems

## Base Building

The game uses very basic base building. If you played Ark, you know how wild you can get with some bases. You're, by default, limited to 3 guild bases and a maximum of 15 pals per base. This is... sometimes just not enough. I created a base specifically for breeding and I just barely squeezed out the 2 slots needed for the pals to be bred. Additionally, the things you can build are implemented in a janky way. You can clip through some terrain but, ideally, you'll be constructing actual buildings. And that relies on a snap-grid.

Also, I can't actually sit in the chair. Bullshit.

## Pal Combat

The easiest way to initiate combat and get strong alpha damage is to simply summon your pal near whatever you're attacking. The summoned pal will immediately aggro and start to attack. Problem is, some pals just... fucking sit there for 27 days doing fuck-all. I've summoned a pal on top of another pal and my pal idled long enough for the enemy to get a full attack off. Weird.
Likewise, some pals seem to require a minimum amount of range between them and the enemy. So you'll see your pal repositioning endlessly or back-hopping 5 times instead of, I dunno, just attacking the fucking enemy.

Aside from that, projectiles seem to have no damage drop-off unless it's a bullet, arrow, or rocket. I've been shot out of the sky from what felt like 50m away by a homing projectile before and instantly died. Certain pal moves, especially ones that move the pal, can also clip them out of terrain. This requires a resummon but sometimes you can use it to break enemy AI.

## Lack of Options

For a breeding base, you'll want a few things:
1) Breeding pens
2) A farm to produce Cake ingredients
3) A farm to feed your pals

While fairly simple, this becomes a logistics nightmare for one specific reason: You can't filter what goes where. For example, I have a cooler next to my ranches to collect milk, Why, then, are my pals transporting my cake ingredients to the Food Box on the other side of the base? Why can't I filter what goes into the Food Box? Why can't I designate that all processed Ingots should go into a specific box? Eventually, you end up with a bit of everything everywhere. Which, admittedly, isn't a problem since base resources are shared and can be accessed from any production bench. However, for someone like me who has hundreds of hours on Factorio and thousands on Rimworld, I wanna know where my shit is.

## Pal Passives

Why the hell can I roll fire attack bonuses on my ice pal when ice is weak to fire?

## The Waiting Game

For reference, I play with 2 other friends on a server I host out of my house. The notable changes we've made were 2.5x exp and 5x egg incubation time. 

If you want to make a strong pal, you're going to be doing a lot of waiting with vanilla settings. Breeding seems to take around 10 minutes to produce an egg. For Huge eggs, I'm seeing a 40 minute incubation period at 5x speed. Just... let that sink in. The egg has a high chance to inherit the passives from the parents as well as randomly spawn with new passives. So, let's say Parent A and Parent B both posses one passive each that you want on a child. The child spawns with both. So you go catch a new Parent A/B with another passive you want. You repeat this until you have the desired child with the 4 desired passives.

Now, this game also has a Pal Condensing mechanic. Basically, feed pals of the same type that you don't want to another pal to power it up. Let's say pals spawn at T0. It takes 4 dupes for T1, and 16 dupes for T2. I haven't looked beyond this because holy shit is that a lot of running around and catching or breeding dupes. Each tier increases the base stats of the pal as well as ranking up their exclusive passive.

Is this required? I have no idea, there's still ~5 bosses I haven't defeated yet.

## Babysitting Bases

My friends and I have arrived at the conclusion that pals in bases don't really do work unless there's a player in the base. Our production, while logged off, was significantly lower than if one of us were to idle in the base overnight. That's... kinda bad. Likewise, your bases get raided. So, to boost production, I idle in my base overnight, get raided, and wake up to find all my pals knocked out. Effectively gimping production. Now, you could argue ""just level up your pals"" but I'd respond with ""What the hell do you want me to do against a raid of 30 lvl 48+ Beakons?""

Additionally, being away from a base seems to do something odd to pal AI. I've left to go hunt some alphas, returned to base, and found most of my flying pals glitched inside of walls. I know that, after a certain point, you're going to be doing fuck-all besides just sitting in base but come on. I don't even know if my coal base is being productive because I'm too busy making sure my breeding pals don't get glitched and stop midway.


### Conclusion

Overall, I think it's a fun game to play with friends but it needs a lot of polish. I think the amount of content in the game is enough for now for the kind of person who's into these kinds of games. I would strongly suggest the devs prioritize polish and bug fixing before adding anything new.

well its part of a game but its very hollow. will it be one of the very few ""early access"" games that actually changes and adds a tons of content?  i highly doubt it, i can only think of 1 early access game that has actually changed dramatically and became a full game. it'd be nice but as of now save your money. this game in its current state should be 5-10 dollars.

there's basically nothing to do outside of the core game loop of gotta catch them all. the boss gyms are a joke. there's the start of a story but then nothing. there's no end and the tree your supposed to get to for the ""story"" is blocked behind a wall.

the riding mechanics are a cool twist to the pokemon genre. 

the environment and the pals look like they were made in 2 separate places by separate people in separate art styles. its be nice if the environment was done in the same art style and beautiful textures like the pals are.

add some towns with npcs to trade or battle with. the current towns are a joke 
add some form of gyms the current gyms are dumb. just open the door fight the bullet sponge boss then leave the gym.
on that subject dungeons and caves are underdeveloped and serve basically no purpose except for the skill fruit at the end. dungeons and caves have 1 to 5 human enemies and only 1 pal if you are lucky. other then that there is 1-2 chests randomly placed in the dungeon that contain useless rewards and 2 at the very end of the dungeon that have a chance to  have skill fruit. other than the skill fruit there is no reason to go into caves or dungeons. also all the dungeons are the same tile set so once you have done one dungeon you have seen them all, very pathetic..

base building needs to allow for a bigger base and needs more things for building

healing pals is bugged, ive looked online and tried the meds, picking them up and setting them on the bed, ive put them in my palbox and no timer starts. there is just no way to heal my plas so now ive got like a box full of sick or injured pals

on the topic of the palbox, the game has designed into it the feature of combining pals. for one stage that is 64 of the same pal infused into the 65th to strengthen it that is 2 of 16 boxes to level up a pal. plus if you have 1 of each pal in male and female for breeding that is already half of the space for pals and getting other pals ranked up using the infuse system. that makes it impossible to naturally rank up your pals. you have to pick 1 or 2 pals and only catch them otherwise you will not have enough space for ranking up.
solution add more space, preferably the only limit is the users hardware

So yeah, that’s this game. Mix in some Valheim/ark and boom. Thing is it is really is addictive. I never liked Valheim enough but I got the idea, same goes for other survival games. The developers really did the “well that all is trendy, let’s make all of it” and it shows.

Pros:
-	Pokemon experience – And with better graphics
-	If you follow “The lore” or what tried to be lore here it gives us a very clear and compelling statement about our rl world and the treatment of animals/ourselves. 
-	Big world. As of now this is early access and the world is already huge. Given, a lot of lategame parts could be filled more with Pals or whatever but I’ll take it
-	You can build a sweatshop! Like for real, put up signs that say “Arbeit macht frei” and you are but one yet unbuildable structure away to reach true glory
-	Sick of you Pals getting sick or pissed? Why not pull the ol’ butcher knife to offer a permanent solution to a temporary problem and get some loot out of it

Cons (grain of salt, this is still early access):
-	It is early access with all the benefits that come with it: regular crashes, glitching beneath structures, dumb af AI are to be expected
-	Lategame structures show there wasn’t any creativity left in the heads of the devs, less monsters, less diverse fauna or sometimes not a Pal in sight for several minutes of flying.
-	Aside from “Go out and catch 10 of every kind” there isn’t any noteworthy way to get exp or to progress in general
-	The “power up feature” lacks polishing. You can fuse Pals and it somewhat makes sense until you realize you need way too many of them and you can only make cakes for breeding so and so fast, and so and so many

Best survival game since Valheim,Survival Genre Comparison
"If you told me 2 years ago after the trailer for this game was shown that it would actually exist, would release for early access in a very functional state, and was $30, I'd call you a liar.
If you told me I would genuinely have fun playing it DESPITE it being early access, I'd never speak to you again and/or call Crisis on you.
I'm amazed and dumbfounded over how much fun I have had with this game. 
Exploration is fun. Base building, though still needing updates, fixes, and more toys, is still fun.
And although some of the designs certainly look similar to other things, for better or worse, there isn't a pal who's look I dislike. 

I'm going to take a break from the game after nearly 80 hours in a single week, but after some updates, patches, and further reveals, I'll happily return with a fresh save and more ideas for bases and who I want in my party.","Value for Money, Early Access Quality, Gameplay Enjoyment"

"One of the best survival games on the market, and that's not hyperbole.

Active dev support, a growing modding scene, and unlike other survival games like it, the grind won't kill you or consume your life. With even a little bit of effort you can see and do most content in this game without much problem. Unlike say, ARK, where you'd need to no life grind for ascendant gear and min-max breeding to even complete the standard boss fight, you don't need to do that here.

You can though, if you enjoy minmaxing, optimizing, and grinding that's all here for you if you want to hit the upper echelons of palworld, wiping bosses out in seconds. 

The new terraria update has made it so with the trust mechanic, even pals with lower stat IVs are still viable for use!

"As of writing I'm only 8 hours in:

I'm taking into account that this is a very Early Access game. So far I'm loving it. It's exactly what you expect: Ark meets Non-Copyright Infringing, Sphere-Portable monsters. In a mechanic sure to be PETA's favorite of 2024, You get to beat the crap out of the cute little critters in order to throw said glowy-spheres at them in order to trap and tame them. After which you can keep them as pets, ride them, use them as slave labor, eat them, or sacrifice them them to the Dark Gods! Whatever, they are just stupid creatures any you are the advanced primate with the fully developed cerebral cortex and bilateral opposable thumbs on your hands.

Pros:
-The visuals are pretty.
-The creatures are cute and well modeled.
-Game-play is fun.

Cons:
-The animations could be a little cleaner.
-There are some clipping issues when you get smashed against the terrain meshing by an enemy attack (getting hit by an enemy ranged attack popped me back out.)
-Content still needs to be fleshed out.
-Needs a cohesive and straight forward story to tie it all together better (RN story is told through discover-able ""journal"" pieces you find across the map, a la Ark; which is a really annoying narrative vessel for me. I like to be spoon fed my stories not have to detective them out, but that's just me.

"If this is your kind of game, I would buy it. You will most likely enjoy it, and get your time out of it without a doubt.

However the game is far from perfect, and I think all the hype has blinded many people regarding this game. Everyone needs to understand this game is unfinished, AKA early access. It may take you 40+ hours to ""complete"" what is here, but this game is a rinse and repeat once you get about 15 hours in. Catch pals, explore unfinished world, complete the same types of dungeons, complete the same types of tower bosses, collect korok seeds, build a base and repeat everything until you reach level 50. 

You will start to see the repetitive gameplay loop around level 12-20. But this is early access, and for an EA title I think its doing really good! Just set your expectations straight if you are reading this and heard so many good things about the game.

Its a great buggy, unbalanced, unfinished game, enjoy it!","Consumer Value, Gameplay Loop, Early Access Status"

"Finally, a game that does not break its back glossing over its aspect of ""Just catching the bug to stick a needle in it and chuck it in a showcase for completionist sake"" by going all in on ""It's alright, I'm his friend. He's my friend. We are all friends now."" While this game gives you a lot more to do with your pals than any similar ""fighting bug-catching game"" out there, it also makes sure to give you the feeling that they are yours now. You can make them fight, work overtime, build your base, or sacrifice them on the altar of your own mad dreams. This game can make you feel like a rich person, building your company on the backs of your corporate slaves.

On that sinister note, most pals are actually pretty cute. No matter how morbid it gets, they will sit there smiling. You do not have to think about the implications of how you made them your friend. You can even treat them well, giving them a comfortable place at your base, while you pick some favorites to go adventuring with. It still offers the wholesome escapism most people seek in this kind of game.

Well, that's that, now some nitpicks: Pal Base AI is still pretty bad, balancing has power creep issues, human enemies are everywhere, weak and annoying, gets pretty grindy after some time, lots of pal skills seem gimmicky or useless, building system hardly better than in ARK, PC controls are awkward.

"First off:  This is more of a survival game with Creature Collector/Monster Tamer Elements that a straight up turned based pokemon like game.  This game is more akin to Ark than Pokemon in terms of play style,   If you go in expecting Pokemon, you will probably be disappointed by more than just the playstyle but also the potential tone.

That being said, I love both genre's that this focuses on, Survival and Creature collection, so this is right up my alley.  I took the day off work, got up in the 2 AM eastern hour and played almost 18 hours day one.  I did not exit the game, I did not crash.  I started a multiplayer world but was playing solo.  Stability, for me, was stellar.

There are some bugs, but nothing that significantly impacted my enjoyment so far.  The humanoid enemies get stuck on terrain a bit, sometimes my farming Pals get hung up on hauling from the berry farm, and it didn't like me having the Sphere assembly line too close to my ranch.  *My ranch stopped working.  A little moving around and everything back to working.

I'll update my review as I play more, but closer to 19 or 20 hours now and almost level 30.  Having a blast, but plan to start again today to make my husband play too.  He won't like it as much as me, but he'll do it anyway.","Genre Expectations, Technical Stability, Personal Enjoyment"

"Great concept, but too much hassle with item management and grind _for me_. Similar to Subnautica and other games in that sense.

Having to go back and forth between bases to manually find out what materials you have, where you have stored it and to figure out what is producing and what has finished is not my thing. Lacks automation of (or at least an option to automate) boring parts of the base management (like producing something if the stock runs low, queing production, automatically move produced items to the chest, auto-sort items between chests, shared chests between bases etc).
A ""master chest"" or a section in the palbox displaying all items and quantities stored in the base/bases (+some tabs/quick filters or similar to quickly display specific items/ingredients/valuables/etc) would make the game more fun (for me).

I do however understand that people who enjoy micromanaging everything, feel excitement from manual item management & like transporting yourself around in an open world enjoys this game (which seems to be quite a few people).","Gameplay Loop, Base Management, Automation Features"

This game is more fun than I thought possible. I can't stop playing, even after finishing the game, that desire to collect all the pals, make an awesome base or bases, even thinking about playing a nuzlocke challenge some time in the future. I love this game. It truly is what I wanted from pokemon for decades.

What a game! 
I was expecting it to just be kind of an edgy pokemon, but man has this game surprised me. There's so many cute monsters to catch, and they all have something to offer, skills, work, some you can even ride!
There's absolutely no expectation of you to mistreat the Pals, by the way, I'm doing great on hard mode and all my pals are well fed, have a nice place to sleep, even a jacuzzi to relax in.
The combat is a little clunky and in hard mode you basically have to only focus on dodging and hiding from the other pals, but it's so much fun, catching is a real challenge in this game.

"Palworld is an intriguing blend of creature collection, open-world survival crafting, and morally ambiguous gameplay, often described as ""Pokémon with guns"".

The tonal mismatch between its cute creature designs and grim mechanics can be off-putting.
The gameplay loop, while initially engaging, can become repetitive due to resource bottlenecks and a lack of variety in later stages.
Some players have expressed a desire for more original creature designs and a more refined approach to its moral complexities.

Despite its flaws, Palworld stands out for its willingness to explore uncharted territory in the survival genre. Its Early Access status leaves room for improvements, and the game has potential to grow into a more polished and balanced experience.","Gameplay Loop, Tonal Mismatch, Moral Complexity"

"The pal management system is broken and not in a fun way. You'll return to base to find one of the pets up in a tree somehow stuck there and now its starving and injured because it’s pathing somehow got broken. Breeding pals also sucks, you have to pick them up manually and put them in the pen, but they will just unassigned themselves and you keep having to reassign them. This is made more difficult by the fact that you will put them down in the pen and will assign them to cutting a tree or not assign them to anything.
I don't like the combat, it’s not the worst but you'll get a creature down to 5% health and try to capture them but repeatedly fail. This is because every time you fail to capture a creature the chance of capturing them goes down more and more which feels like it should be the opposite. On top of that if you miss with one of your spheres you just lose it, this is especially bad in the late game when the resources needed to craft higher tier spheres get more and more grindy.
When I use the scroll wheel on my mouse to switch between my weapons it keeps going back and forth between the two options. The game needs an item bar for you to just press one button and switch between your pickaxe, weapon, or gun because it especially in problem in combat if you are trying to switch from melee to ranged.
I don't like the cartoony art-style that much and all these other issues on top of that have just killed any enjoyment I get out of playing this game. You may not care about these issues and if so, you'll probably have fun. The game just feels very under-baked to me, and I would advise against getting it unless these issues are fixed.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Mechanics, Combat Balance"

"Palworld adds everything folks might want from a ""modern pokemon game"". It is a big explorable world that you can travel around with your Pals. The pals interact with the world very naturally, fire type pals will light up the area around you at night, water type pals will put out fires in your base, and pals with hands will help carry things, cut down trees, or help you mine stone. You can send lambol pals to sit in a ranch and produce wool like a sheep, and set down ice type pals next to a fridge to cool down your food. It lets you live with your pals in a way pokemon fans have wanted with their pokemon forever. 

It's very promising, and despite the bloated crafting-survival genre, the pal spin makes it feel very fresh. 

Problems:
The base building is undercooked currently. There are no corner tiles for roofs, no single tile roof peaks, and there are similar missing tiles for the stairs. Most building tiles refuse to clip even slightly into most pieces of terrain so you can't build a base on that cool ruined fortress, and so on. Building tiles hate water, so you can't build walls up to a beach front. Stairs, roofs, and ceiling tiles are very finicky, and most tiles refuse to connect horizontally to other pieces, meaning you cannot, for the most part, build bridges. Lastly, for the base building, there is no indicator for what is an ""important area"", meaning you can't build parts of your base in and around boss arenas, main story towers, and so on, yet there is no clear indicator until you attempt to build in that area. So half your base could be inaccessible and you wouldn't know until you started trying to build there.

The terrain is undercooked as well. Just at a glance I think most people get the sense that the firearms, dirt, trees, grass, base-building tiles, and npc homes, all just don't quite belong, like they're made of store bought assets with no concern for the aesthetic of the characters and pals. Farther flung islands seem very flat, open and have their boring terrain hidden by a mountain of trees. The starting island is very detailed, but that care and craft disappears surprisingly quickly when you look at the total size of the world map. Lastly, the terrain both in the over-world and in the caves is incredibly unoptimized. One big tell is when playing on lower graphics settings and watching individual rocky stair-steps load in one at a time. Not staircases, steps. What should be a single terrain-piece cave chunk is actually a couple hundred small doodad assets glued together, and this is causing most of the frame drops in this game. 

The inventory can't keep up with the pals. There needs to be, at the very least, a white-list and black-list option for the inventory and the chests in the base. Some pals can pick up and store items on the ground, which is useful until you realize every individual pal has its own mental sorting system, and they wont tell you what it is, meaning your base will either be very spread out (to keep wood away from the stone chest, and so on) or it will be very disorganized. Not to mention your pals will constantly try to eat all your wheat so you can't make flower with it. 

All 3 of these major problems can best be described as ""Undercooked"", which makes sense given it's an early access game. The Pals themselves seem ready for a complete, triple A game. The base building, terrain, and inventory systems just need some time and resources to catch up. A terrible base building system, store-bought unoptimized terrain, and permanently cluttered inventory all means this is still the best ""pokemon game"" to have come out in the last 18 years. It doesn't have that triple A studio polish, but it certainly could with time. 

Last complaint is that I don't have a chillet plushy in real life but that's unrelated to the gameplay critique.","Pokemon Fan Fulfillment, Pal-World Integration, Base Building Quality"

✪ Home server tools were made available at launch with easy setup and plenty of customization options within its ini file. These options are also available in-game to those who would rather play solo or host a co-op lobby instead of their own server.

✪ In most games that feature creature or character collection, just about everything we acquire lacks any kind of relevance beyond personal preference. We get them, then they go into storage while we keep our favorite few (or the meta, if you roll that way) in our party. In Palworld, every catch feels important because every Pal exists beyond simply being used for combat. 

✪ Pals are phenomenal creatures that I’ve already started to love more than the many species’ in competing worlds. With every Pal having their own set of animations, personalities, functions, sounds and reactions to the world around them, it’s hard not to wish for more from other games. I just hope they maintain this quality as more Pals are added to the roster.

✪ Its map is massive and brimming with potential, featuring a lot of areas that scream “content update”. I’d love to see more towns, villages or even the addition of enemy headquarters eventually, but what we have now is alright thanks to how dense the Pal population is.

✪ After you build a base, it’ll often be attacked by random groups of enemies. This turns what could have simply existed as a place to calm down, build up your stash and check on your Pals into a meaningful grind. How and where your bases are built matters, with the efficiency of your Pals being important to keep up with.

✪ As someone who usually ends up building the bases, gathering resources and taking care of the wildlife that my friends bring back home, I’m incredibly appreciative of how automated the game’s resource management is. Pals can take care of every tedious task survival games offer, all while mostly taking care of themselves. This means that even though I personally love doing all the things I mentioned, I get to do more *with* my friends instead of focusing on doing stuff *for* them.

✪ Boss fights are scattered around the map, offering a solid challenge as long as you’re within a few levels of them. They also function like the Pals you find in the wild, meaning they can be caught despite being bigger, more powerful and occasionally having different moves.

✪ Many will go on about how much the game relies on shock humor and black comedy, but what we’re actually presented with is quite tame. Everything we see is just stuff that happens off-screen in the world of Pokemon, just goofier thanks to the lack of blood and comical use of ragdoll physics. I also don’t know about you, but all of my Pals are happy to work for me. These goobers have fluffy beds, their own hot tubs, cooked meals and are free to stop working whenever they want. Abuse? Enslavement? Not in this house, but you do you.

✪ Its existence is a gift that keeps on giving, even beyond the game itself. From the immense amounts of success without press coverage before its release, to journalists and other game devs blatantly being bitter about the game blowing up. Even if this spark fades in a couple weeks, the entertainment it’s provided has been great across the board.

[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]
✘ Whenever we craft, we have to hold down our interaction button until the item is finished. In the beginning, this doesn’t take much time since most things can be crafted within a couple seconds. As we near mid-game, we’re better off getting Pals to do everything for us because of how long things can take.

✘ Similar to the last issue, bulk crafting items is tedious because of how quantity selection works. You can only go up by ones, tens, and the MAX button. You also can’t hold the selection button to make it go faster, so you’re clicking a lot just to reach the amount you want. 

✘ We’re limited to three bases when playing alone, which is incredibly limiting but at least kind of makes sense. However, when playing in a guild, you go from being allowed three bases by yourself to just three bases shared among everyone in the guild.

✘ At the moment, Dungeons aren't worth doing after your first couple runs. They mostly use the same exact prefabs, don't offer much XP and aren't nearly as fun as the game's bosses.

✘ The requirements to enhance Pals through Pal Condensation are a bit too steep, making it something most won't bother doing even with their favorite Pals. To get a Pal to 4-stars, you'll need to catch 116 of the same exact pal, with the XP bonuses stopping after your 10th. 

[h1]Nitpicks[/h1]
• There isn’t any background music outside of combat. This isn’t terrible, but I think even a short song that plays while you explore would be great. Especially if they can give us different tunes for each biome.

• Base building has a solid foundation, but it needs a lot of work. The overlapping issues, height adjustment limitations, lack of furniture functionality and more leave a lot to be desired. 

• I’ve yet to experience any serious bugs, but the ones I’ve been through are still pretty annoying. Just about all of them involve Pal behavior, from the Pals being stuck in place to getting lost under the map. There’s also an issue where gathering Liffmunk effigies to raise your capture rate actually decreases the rate.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
Palworld has quickly become one of my favorite Survival games, and if Pocketpair actually sticks with it, I can absolutely see myself coming back for hundreds of hours. I’m very much looking forward to every update and hope Palworld has a long life ahead of it.

"I'm not gonna lie. When this game first released, I clowned my husband for wanting to play. I'm not big into Pokemon. I've seen him play those games, and they seemed childish with a lack of depth and creativity (which after reading other reviews, I realize it's a common sentiment). We eventually downloaded Palworld, and I've been hooked ever since. Once I figured out the hotkeys and understood the basics, I didn't want to stop playing. My husband and I are locked in to this game. Is it perfect? Of course not. We realize it's still early release, and there are plenty of bugs and things to be worked out. For example, he went to play last night, and his game was wiped. He retained his rank and inventory, but the history of every boss he defeated and the entire map was wiped. Yet, still...we play.

"What can I say about Palworld?
There is a lot of great game play choices that, when all of them are put together, help create this fascinating world and really bring it all to life. With that said however, I can't help but feel as though bits and pieces of this game feel uninspired or lifeless.
Let's get the negatives out of the way since there are so few that I can specifically explain. For starters, when I said that some bits and pieces of this game feel lifeless, it's because the world sometimes feels rather empty with not a whole lot going on. The world of Palworld could really expand a lot from simply fleshing out the various locations you can roam. If you add some towns or cities here and there, add some characters you can interact with (besides just merchants), and add various activities or missions you can accomplish, the world of Palworld will significantly feel more alive. But as it is, there is 1 town towards the beginning of the game, and some towers in which bosses are inside of. Aside from that, there is no other civilization. I mean, there is some empty castles that look like they're in the aftermath of a ruin, but there is little to no context as to why they're in that state. If there was various towns, or large cities to explore with interesting characters to interact with I truly think Palworld would feel more alive.

Now let's discuss the uninspired bits and pieces that make up this game that I stated earlier. When I say uninspired I'm referring to the Pals, the world, and a lot of the text that appears in the game in particular. Obviously the Pals are inspired from Pokemon. Anubis is Lucario, Jetragon is Salamance, Grizzbolt is Electabuzz, Nightwing is Pidgeot, Jolthog is Shaymin, etc. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the Pals look beautiful or cunning, but a lot of them also feel like they're a copy and paste from Pokemon. I wish more of the Pals were more original, because as an avid enjoyer of Pokemon over the years, and growing up with the games and the anime, seeing them blatantly rip off some of the creations is just no bueno. 

As for the world, I'd be lying if I didn't say it reminds me a lot of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In fact, even the text in which is used for when you reach a new location or region in the game is the same exact text utilized in The Breath of the Wild! Nintendo really did lend creative inspiration in more way than one to Palworld, huh? Even the boss towers, or the climbing mechanics of this game resemble that of The Breath of the Wild. And let's not stop there... that GIANT tree couldn't be from Elden Ring, could it? All kidding aside, I wish Palworld took more of an original approach when creating the world in which we explore and capture Pals. 

With those negatives out of the way, this game has an addicting gameplay loop. Catch a Pal, build a base, gather resources to craft other resources. With the addition of utilizing weapons, including GUNS, and being able to use those said weapons on Pals is sincerely funny / amazing. I never thought I'd enjoy a survival game, aside from Minecraft, but I can't help but exemplify that I enjoyed this one A LOT. With all of these gameplay choices being tied together it's hard not to enjoy it, let alone get caught in the addicting loop of catching Pals, building your base thoroughly, and gathering resources to craft other resources. What's even better is that this game is multiplayer! My friends and I played this game for hours on end, catching Pals together and exploring all there is that this game has to offer. We shared a lot of laughs and excitement, and I would be lying if I didn't say that playing this game with a friend or two really does boost the replayability of everything. 

In the end how do I feel about Palworld? I think it has a lot to offer, and I think it will have great future updates as well. I'm excited for the world to become more fleshed out over time, and have new Pals be added. I'm excited to see what characters they may include, or towns they may build. I'm excited to see how weather or natural distasters while in combination with the different region's temperatures can coincide together. I'm excited to see how base building can progress in the future and how much fun it'll be to do with a friend. 

In the end I rate Palworld as a 7.5/10 game. The game is addicting and fun!","Gameplay Design, World Design"

"This is a 10/10 in my book even though there are some small bugs and here is why:

It's really hard to enovate in the gaming industry we got it all (almost) but you can take exisiting things and combine them
and they did it perfectly.
the small bugs will get fixed over time but it's not hindering the gameplay much.
this game is easly 100+ hours of content which is a great value for the price.
the art is beautiful (although i think they could change some pals to look less similer to some other known monsters) and the scenery is beautiful, you can just fly around and enjoy the bioms.

the gameplay is balanced and interesting and full of content so many things to do and places to explore
but not in an overwhelming way.
really fun to play with friends and by yourself.

"While I recommend this game, the game is early access and it really shows. A lack of optimization, accessibility settings, bugs and crashes really hold the game back.

The crashes right now are pretty constant right now while playing on my Steam Deck. Even running on the lowest settings, the game hard crashes the entire console, requiring a restart around every 30 minutes. PC seems to be slightly more stable, with less crashes overall, but still there. I also think the game has a memory leak as my ram slowly increases over time the longer I play before a crash.
Many of the crashes seem to happen when the game autosaves, especially when entering or exiting a dungeon.

For the game, it's definitely somewhat mid in terms of gameplay. The combat can feel somewhat unfair, as the dodging ability doesn't seem to grant I-frames? Pals deal a lot of damage, and wild Pals often chase after you instead of your own Pals, which can be sometimes frustrating when certain attacks seem unavoidable.

The design/art of the game is incredibly inconsistent and sometimes just bad. The Pals are wonderfully designed and animated. I believe they're the strongest in terms of design, and it looks like a lot of care went into them. The Humans are quite ugly in comparison, with a limited character creator which looks unlike anything that exists in the same world as the Pals. I think some better faces would make the character passable, as they are more realistic or oddly defined in comparison to the more cartoony or anime style of the Pals. The world is also a bit inconsistent in the same way, contrasting harshly with the design of the Pals to the point that they look strange. Dungeons especially use assets which look like they're emulating the stone halls and caves in Elden Ring or a similar artstyle, and it just doesn't fit in with the rest of this game at all. (It doesn't look bad, but it belongs in a different game, if that makes sense.)

The AI of Pals and Humans are very unreliable, although Human NPCs are much worse in my experience. You'll often find Humans walking into walls and static objects in combat, or simply stand still while you wittle their health down with a spear or axe. NPCs from the same faction also sometimes aggro each other, leading to odd interactions in which I've found camps where everyone is shooting each other when I arrive.
Wild Pal AI is a bit better, with a bit better path finding and less issues getting stuck. Their combat can sometimes be questionable, since they might change aggro to focus the player for long periods of time, turning away from your Pal fighting them to run hundreds of meters to use an attack on you. Regardless of whether the player has attacked them, they seem to prioritize hitting the player. It would be better if they prioritized based on who's hurting them the most, as that will often be your Pals anyway, but burst damage from player weapons could aggro them as well.

The base building is fun but doesnt work well with any of the AI in the game. Invasions, random events which cause enemies to attack your base, are useless since spawned enemies can't pathfind a route to or into any bases I've made. Enemies can attack your defensive walls if they find a way there, but they often fail to even recognize the obstacle to start attacking it. If they do, their damage isn't enough to actually break in.
Your own Pals, which you assign to work at your base, randomly spawn outside of your base, and cannot path find a way back into the zone, and do not reset without player intervention. They eventually begin starving or going insane because they can't walk through open gates or cross the border back into your base area if they fall out. This happens constantly if you fast travel to your base, which you will need to do often. It would be ideal if they always spawned near the center of the base instead of in seemingly random locations every time. 

The other issue is the question of why I'm playing this game. The story (or lack therof) makes the game seem aimless. The opening cutscene establishes nothing outside of hinting at battling in the towers, but I have no idea why. There are other human NPCs, but I have no idea why they're hostile or what they're doing here. I have no idea what the towers are, and why I should find them all, as they don't seem to have any purpose outside of offering another Pal boss fight, which already spawn randomly in the overworld. Is there even an end game, like is there anything that comes after the towers? Why is my character even here?

Some minor critiques that are too small to write details:
*Upgrading your damage stat is so impractical for the amount of levels you need to make a notable difference.
*Every building/crafting task the player does requires holding down the button the entire time you work on it, instead of just a single click to begin. I don't mind waiting for it but it's annoying that it has to be held, sometimes up to a minute for big tasks
*Mounts losing stamina for running and jumping is a but too limiting on players, especially since they seem to have barely more stamina than a human player. The world is quite large, and limiting the players movement despite the use of mounts is unfun. I don't think it should be unlimited, but I cant believe a horse type animal could run for a shorter amount of time than a human could, or a bird flying an even shorter distance. Could bird at least get gliding as an ability, so they can travel horizontally longer?
*Dungeons would benefit from a mini map, as they can be really confusing with their randomly generated layout. They aren't very fun to explore either, as they're really large, mostly empty caves, which sometimes spawn chests. I have encounter Dungeons which spawned glitched so that all the chests were empty.
*Pals blocking spheres feels like the most inconsistent mechanic in the game. Pals which are asleep can deflect them while asleep. Pals which are low health can block spheres sometimes, even if their catch rate is quite high, simply if the sphere isn't ""good enough"" quality. Even then, they can still block the sphere if their health isn't low enough, or they just randomly decide to block it. Often trying to lower their health further ends up killing them, which is infuriating. It seems very frustrating that spheres have a chance of a chance of actually catching (a chance to actually connect, then the chance for the Pal to escape the sphere.) Even easy catches sometimes waste a ton of spheres.

In all, this game is still one of the better creature-collector games available, especially since the creatures are so wonderfully designed. It's just held back by a lack of polish (which might improve over time) to the AI, the visual inconsistency, and a lack of (currently planned by the devs) features like Pal v Pal battling, and long term things to do besides collecting.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Balance"
"So many things could be added that would help like when you press ""p"" to open party menu you should be able to click to feed a pal if you have food in my inventory or feed bag. Also if the stats for your pal showed when you hover over it in party menu like it does in the palbox that would be so nice.","UI Usability, Quality of Life"

"This is an excellent world-exploring friend-catching base-building adventure with a LOT of interesting angles. It's extremely polished right now for a '0.2.1' Early Access title, with a gigantic map and an enormous amount of stuff to do. There's a wide versatility in how you want to treat the world and vice-versa: Captures can be done stealthy and silently, or through beatdowns and aggression. Pals can be coddled, pet, loved and treated as partners, or they can be worked to the bone before eventually going under the cleaver for meat.

Also, Humans can be captured in Pal spheres.

They are no exception to the last statement in the first paragraph.

"This game came as a recommendation from a friend who knows me really well.  I thought as soon as I started playing that the person may have missed the mark, and that I was going to hate it as the aesthetics are not something I'm generally about, but soon... very soon my itchy brain was being scratched by all my favorite things.  Resource farming? No pressure world exploration and hidden goodies? BAM.  we got em in spades.   There are a few funny issues with clipping and glitches, but honestly nothing that has made me explode with a fit of gamey gamey rage. 

Surprisingly delightful.  I'm enjoying it thoroughly.","Aesthetics, Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability"
"Surprisingly good game, came into it with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Runs fantastic even on my old 2070 Super. Fair amount of content right now however, past 100 hours you've kind of seen it all and done it all. Fortunately, it's still early release so more is to come, and you can't beat 100 hours worth of good content for $30. Could be considered the love child of Pokemon and Breath of the Wild.

"There's a surprising amount of things to do in the game despite just being in early access.

The amount of Pals you can capture— around 111, and that's without the variants— as well as the amount of ground you can travel is really amazing, That, and the base building and resource management portion of the game really makes for a fun experience on paper.

However, it's not really without its quirks. While Palworld boasts a great amount of decorations you can build for your base, the actual base building experience is horrendous. Assigning Pals to certain stations is also a pain at times, and there's the occasional bug where they stop doing their jobs when permanently assigned to a station (this is certainly apparent with breeding after fast traveling to another waypoint).

After defeating all of the Tower bosses, there's really not much to do except capture the Legendary pals scattered around the world. 

The game still needs a bit of polish and QoL work at its certain state, but I do recommend people getting the game if they aren't deterred by such problems. Can't wait to see where this game goes!

There are a lot of new refreshing takes on the monster collecting genre in Palworld, but unfortunately it's very obvious that the developers are inexperienced.

The game has an incredible amount of jank, in almost every aspect. The world is lackluster and the monster ai is barely tolerable. Starting from mid game onward, the game just becomes the same routine of grinding materials to level up and waiting for different countdowns to finish. 
There are a plethora of bugs that make the experience quite frustrating a lot of the times

"The game is great, it's a lot of fun. Then why is my review a no?

Balance, and not in a ""this is overpowered"" way, but in a ""why is it taking so f-ing long to X"" way.
Levels are unbalanced, going from level 54 to 55 feels like it takes more XP than what it took to get to level 50 from 0.

The game straight up becomes not fun towards the end game when you're nearing ""100%"" completion.

New islands are straight up impossible with anti-air missiles (????) and ninjas that can nearly one shot you and your pals. Unless you spend 800 hours selectively breeding and condensing the ultimate pal, it's just not fun at that point.

"Not A Pokemon Clone

I first picked up Palworld because everyone marketed it as 'Pokemon with Guns' and I thought 'why not' but I think that title's misleading. I've played through most of the mainline Pokemon games and I don't think that does Palworld justice, it's a different kind of game and is not an RPG like Pokemon is. 

But before you buy though, I should point out that the game is in 'alpha' and as such is unfinished- as in the main storyline can't be completed. You can play for quite a while- I have about 80+ hours on one of my saves, but most of that is levelling up for when additional features are added. Of course, I am also rating the game considering the fact that it is an alpha, and that I'm expecting more features to be added.

Gameplay

The game isn't like Pokemon- it's  more like Minecraft or No Man's Sky in that it involves working on your base and exploring. You just have these things called Pals helping you.

The game's gameplay loop is simple- you can level up your base and your Pals, and get new features and use resources to get better weapons and such. There are a few 'Tower Bosses' that you can fight, but the gameplay is mainly doing a similar thing over and over- though to the game's credit it does make this enjoyable.

The main storyline seems to be about getting to the tree at the centre of the world, but you can't get there- as I said before, that part is unfinished. There isn't a whole lot of 'story' or 'lore'  though it does exist somewhat, the game is mainly about levelling up.

Pros

I liked a lot of things about the game- the core gameplay loop is very fun and you can easily find yourself spending hours before you know it. 
- I like a lot of the Pal designs- many of them look adorable or terrifying in different ways, and the fact that you can see them wandering around your base working on stuff just feels great

- Exploring the world is also extremely fun

- Your Pals can do a lot to help you out, and when you realise that it's astonishing- the game doesn't seem to want you to do anything, for anything that you want to do you can easily say 'There's a Pal for that'

- Although I said the lore is limited, its not nonexistant, you can pick up journal pages and speak to a few NPCs (NPCs that you can talk to are few and far between) to get a glimpse of the lore

- The technical performance is pretty good for an alpha, I think my game's only crashed once in my entire playthrough, and while I have encountered some bugs (which is to be expected) most of them were minor and all it took was resetting the game to fix them. A lot of AAA games do not run as well on their final releases, to put that into perspective

I should note that I've only played singleplayer and can't comment on the multiplayer aspect of it.

Cons

- The gameplay loop can be very infuriating if you don't know what's going on- I tried to do this without a guide initially but I do recommend that if you're stuck for longer than half an hour to simply look stuff up or find the most optimal way to do something

- Some of the Pal designs are just reskins of old pals, like there is an 'Ignis' series where it's basically the same Pal, but a Fire element one and it's just color palette swapped. A lot of games do this to be fair like Digimon, but I've generally found it to be kind of lazy and I would've preferred more unique and varied designs

- Given there isn't much story, if you don't want to progress yourself there's little reason to play and I can see some Players quitting after a while because of this

Bang For Buck

For the price the game is going for, I feel like I've definitely already gotten my money's worth with just the alpha.

Overall

I rate Palworld a 8.5/10, it's a very solid game that I do recommend trying out- though this last score is subject to change based on any new features they bring in.

"A fun and, most importantly, working co-op from the very start of the game. Full gamepad support. Overall good quality for early access.

However, the game has a lot of non-critical bugs, which together leave an unpleasant aftertaste. If the developers release the game roughly ""as is"", it will be a disaster, which is why there is a negative review in advance.

The main problem of the game is NPC pathfinding. It's hard to find a game where it's done worse. At the same time, it is impossible to build an effective base without overcoming the vagaries of pathfinding. And this is more like reverse engineering than playing a video game.

I liked the game, I hope it will be fixed before release.","Co-op Experience, Technical Stability, AI Pathfinding"

"TL:DR: 6/10 good (unfinished) game/potentially 8 or even 9 later on. little something for everyone. Easy to Hard modes with a custom setting that has more choices then a Bethesda character creation screen. Fallout 3 lovable jank levels on a LENOVO computer with intel core i7-9700 cpu, 16 GB ram. Virtual memory 38.4 GB. Intel UHD Graphics 630 Graphics Family. It's worth the money, even better if you get it on sale.
If the Devs see this: look at Azure Dreams monsters for inspiration next. U-boat is my favorite. ^.^

At lvl 41 and 184 hrs at the time of this review: 
It's been a long time since I've felt this feeling from a game. Like FANF, Undertale, Poppy Playtime, ect. had before in the past. It feels like the beginning of something big. These games gave you curiosity about the world and the people in it. It gives me the feeling that it CAN become something great, OR it can become another shit game rotting on the pile of poor decisions of the devs. It's tittering on that that knifes edge right now,  

I had a hard time getting the game to stop crashing first. I finally started to start working after I used -dx12 in the launch options section in the General settings of Palworld on steam. There are youtube videos to help with those issues, but the devs REALLY need to get that fixed so you need to jump though hoops to play. That or I have a shit computer. 
As for jank, bugs, and breaks: nothing too game breaking. In the beginning caves/dungeons I gotten above the map by using the grapple hook in the center of the big open areas. You can short range teleport pals into walls if you fail to catch em since they come out up and to the right of where you threw your sphere. A list of other things. Annoying sure, but like I said above it has jank levels of Fallout 3. Annoyingly lovable jank you can tell your friends about and have a good laugh. Now with the computer specks I listed above I can run Palworld on low graphics somewhat comfortably while running youtube and a web browser (not recommended to run anything at he same time as Palworld). Palworld is a CPU hog to be sure for me at least. If the the Pal jank becomes too much then just slaughter the offending pal to teach the game a lesson.

Now Palworld is made for the long range attacker. Sure you can make a bat or a spear, your bread & butter is going to be your long range stuff/pals which attack mostly with mid to long range attacks. No claws or biting. Guns take a bit to get too. Game play is fine/fun. Building is fun but base space is limited, but you can have multiple bases. (everything deteriorates outside of the base till it breaks). The world is enjoyable, varied, and memorable enough to be talk to someone else about it and have them understand where you are talking about.  Dungeons aren't that varied in shape or Pals, but make up for it in looks. A hot area will look different from a starting area dungeon. OH you can slide in the game by pressing the crouch button while running. 

Catch over killi is the name of the game in Palworld. You get more EXP for catching rather than killing. Also get the items when you catch them as well. Pal spheres disappear after use, so if you miss you waste a sphere. Pals themselves are helpful (when not bugging or being difficult) and your workforce. Unless to like the F key on your keyboard a little too much and wish to wear it out, Pals are your to to for base building, resource gathering, food growing and manufacturing. As well as for protection, riding, and gliding. Early levels means you can't have guns, BUT you can build guns for your PALs as a unlock-able limited PAL move. Or (with other unlock-able moves)  turn your PAL in to the weapon like a grenade, grenade launcher, flamethrower, ect. They are upgrade-able. Some PALs are just suited to base work. It's possible to breed pals/find eggs and get PALs you haven't seen or too high of level to catch at the time. 

Story: No story per say. You're on a ""deserted"" cluster of islands with ancient civilization traces all over. Deal with it by force.  There are journals to find, but that's it. The NPCs mostly look alike, with no in depth personality or looks. About one or two lines of dialog for each.  One friendly small settlement with 6 or 7 people in it. A weak part of the game. I would like to see some personality given to these NPCs in the updates. Maybe a quest or two. Different clothes and faces too. 

I've gone over what I thought was important to talk about, and will add more if I remember/new stuff changes the game drastically. It's a good 6 almost 7 out of 10 game and I feel worth your time and money. Even in it's current early access state. Also more and more mods are being made if you're into that. I could see this turned into an manga or anime at some point. Hope this was worth the read and thank you for your time.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Emotional Engagement"

I find that there's a lot of good to this game, but the mid/late game still needs a ton of polishing. There is a lot that goes on at one point and it can feel quite overwheling. You spend a lot of time gathering material, you're almost always crafting something, enhancing your base(s), curing your pals, 

The Good

-There's a lot to do
-the graphics are great
-It's what i was hoping to get in Pokemon Arceus 
-the names of the pals are witty
-it's literally if breath of the wild and pokemon had a baby, except pokemon are near extinction because 90% of the map is empty

The Annoying

-I love exploring the map, but it can get really painful with mount and flying speed. There doesnt seem to be a way to enhance your pals travelling speed or raise their stamina, so whatever pal you have is what you get. 
-You need to collect green effigies to add a passive upgrade to your catching rate. I kinda wish that the map put a mark where the effigy was collected. When playing with friends it can get super annoying to follow your friend only to find out that you already got that effigy. 
-The random raids are fun. they dont take place too often. The enemy pathing, however, could use a lot of improvement. I make walls around my base and the enemies still find a way to walk through a small crack in the wall. I was able to place a wall in such a way where the enemies would get stuck standing on a rock and never attack.... easy mode but kinda lame.
-It's quite annoying that the F key is used for many different actions. As much as it's great, it gets very tricky to do the right action when youre in a highly populated area. I press F to open a box, but nope my pal is too close to me so i pick him up instead. When you do that 5 times in a row it gets super frustrating. OK i moved a bit and press F again and nope this time the game registered that i want to fly so i jump on my mount and now i cant open my box. Oh wait i cant get off my bird in front of a box so i need to move again.
-I think that there are too many versions of the pal sphere for the level cap in the game. it seems that every ball is good for ~10 enemy levels (i.e if someone is level 15 you should be using at least a T2 pal sphere). At one point you will end up with hundreds of T1 spheres and have no use for them. It doesnt matter if your character is the same level as a 45 pal, a T1 ball has less than a 0.5% catch rate (instant fail). It kinda sucks that the lower balls are absolutely useless towards end game, i would mimic pokemon a little more and have T1 balls have a success rate on higher tier pals. I'd also like to see different spheres that have better catch rates depending on specific conditions (night time balls, in hot areas, in cold areas, etc)
-The game tries to recycle lower level mats to make better material, but i still find that you are stuck with a tons of level level mats at one point with no use to them. IT would be great if you could recycle mats to produce better mats. For example, exchanging 10 T1 pal spheres will give you 1 T2 sphere (or something like that)
-The bugs in the game are annoying but aren't game breaking. I've spawned from the loading screen under the map, and the only way out way to fly up to the ground (yes that sounds weird) and then hop off your bird which gives you slightly more height for you to pop out of the earth. My friend was also attacking a pal in a dungeon and the pal body slammed my friend and i literally witness the pal push my friend through the ground into the depths of hell, and my friend immediately respawned in our base. 
-leveling gets really painful towards the mid/late game (35+). The amount of pals you need to capture vs the amount of balls you need to throw vs the amount of material you need to gather + repair your gear. It took me ~10 hours to get from 30-35 when it took me about the same amount of time to go from 1-30. Mind you, as i mentioned there is so much happening in the game that you get distracted very quickly and veer off from your personal objectives. Lets go gather stuff, OU LOOK A NEW PAL, lets to go get that waypoint, OUU LOOK an Effigy. 
-This game ain't for people who have ADHD
-It kinda sucks that my friend can't play the world we started until i'm playing (I'm the host). Would be cool if either of us can solo play and not lose progess
-pals don't evolve like in Pokemon, even if there are obvious evolutions in this game.","Production Quality, Gameplay Experience, Accessibility Factors"
"Where to begin with Palworld?  At first glance, it's easy to dismiss it as just another Pokémon clone. But trust me, this game is something else entirely.

Sure, it draws heavy inspiration from various games and genres. You'll notice familiar sound effects, cutscenes reminiscent of Breath of the Wild, and capturing mechanics that echo Pokémon Legends: Arceus. The core gameplay even reminds me of survival titles like ""The Forest.""

However, Palworld takes all these elements and blends them into a unique and surprisingly addictive experience. It's a game that defies easy categorization, and that's what makes it so special.

Yes, it's clearly an early access title. DLSS/FSR isn't working on Steam Deck, performance could be optimized, and crafting takes a while (though this encourages you to utilize your Pals, which is a clever gameplay mechanic). But honestly, I've seen AAA games with triple the price tag and far more issues.

Kudos to Pocketpair for creating something truly original. I'm loving Palworld and can't wait to see how it evolves!","Genre Innovation, Gameplay Addictiveness, Technical Stability"

Absolute blast to play,Gameplay Enjoyment
Ark survival/Pokemon/7 days to die/ several other big name games and the best of their mechanics wrapped into one game of awesomeness! A little glitchy but not bad at all and sometimes hilarious. I love it so far and look forward to the future of the game getting better and better as I play.,"Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability, Future Potential"
"While the whole ""Pokemon with guns"" thing doesn't really come into play until mid to late game, it's still an incredibly fun game, with tried and true open world game mechanics, a fun set of creatures to fight and capture for your own, base management gameplay (which is decent as is, but has the potential to be so much better, which is why I'm excited this game is still in early access), and so much more! Definitely worth the pricetag of 30$, especially with how expensive some other, less original game franchises are markiung their products at (looking at you, COD).","Gameplay Mechanics, Value for Money, Early Access Potential"

Update:
To elaborate. This game scratches that survival game itch, and Pokemon itch simultaneously. Splash in some gun-play tomfoolery. Then it really does make my brain dance in many ways. 
The Devs have lightning in a bottle. Powdery. White. Lightning. 

That being said if you don't like survival games don't bother. It is grindy. Like survival games can be. You need wood, get wood. You need stone, get stone. You need food, get food. It progressively gets more tedious as you go on, yet easier in other ways.  It's also grindy in the same way Pokemon can be. Capturing all the 'PALS' is tedious especially if you're a completionist. You need to catch 10 of each Pal to get an XP reward. Also many more if you decide to ride or die with a certain one. The reason being that for some inexplicable reason and to some peoples dismay. You make a cannibalistic smoothie to feed to the chosen Pal to make them stronger. Which gives the Pal a star level, you can max them out to 5 stars. Then when they have a taste (much like crack) they need more to grow stronger. 6 becomes 16, and so on (haven't seen how much it escalates yet personally but I can imagine it's pretty steep). So getting a 5 star Pal (to no-ones surprise) takes a long ass time. 

The fighting mechanics are simple. Could be a negative or positive depending on what really tickles your fancy. But for what it is it works. My only gripe is the AI of Pals and enemies. Especially the interaction that occurs in raids. The enemy AI doesn't trigger aggression until they enter you base at a set point. SO. You can completely negate the threat of them by building a wall around your bases and the enemy AI just runs into the walls doing nothing. Allowing you to just kill them with AOE attacks. Or until your Pals teleport through your walls to the outside and fight the enemy AI that is just gleefully accepting death. Then after the blood shed you have to go through the process of getting your Pals back in the walls. 

Game has some issues but as far as EA Game Releases go, it's pretty good. Now it will be really. REALLY GOOD. If they really take this as far as they can. It has lots of potential.","Gameplay Appeal, Grind Intensity, Genre Fit"

"the game is awesome, once it gets workshop mods, it will be one of the best 2024 game guaranteed and maybe a few multiplayer and single player cross-saves, like you can use a char on your single player world in multi or use your single player world in multi, it'd make it less annoying, having to restart from scratch, i've had to restart from scratch 3 times now","Game Quality, Mod Support, Cross-Save Features"

"love the game, wish it was complete. it does feel open world and you can skyrim horse up a mountain. The game is an 8/10. it does get repetitive catching the same animal so you can upgrade them and some are better than others. You can make any pal work but some will be better than others. Unless you get the 1 in a million odds of all 4 gold stat boosts. I have not finished the game so i could be wrong about that last piece.","Open World Design, Gameplay Loop, Content Completeness"

"For an early access game, I am extremely satisfied and hopeful for the future. With how I heard previous titles were abandoned, I am fearful. This still does not make me want to give up. Hopefully this give them the financial kick they need to grow and make Palworld an actual competition to Pokemon.

It do miss some aspect of Pokemon we could hope for, since as evolution (which is one of my big hope). It is glitchy, and need more building material like available in Rust or Ark, and the building system could use improvement.

Being like Ark, it is meant as a multiplayer game, so going solo or with a small group will be a different experience. Example: A somewhat cold egg will take 3 hours (I think) to hatch. Tweaking with settings could resolve this.

Graphic wise, everything look great. It is what we expected and never got from Pokemon Legend and S/V, and is stable enough.

To the dev: Don't give up, this game and concept has potential and hopefully will bring to sequels and more.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Gameplay Features"

gud game. starts out a lil goofy but ends up being chill,"Overall Quality, Pacing, Atmosphere"
"So far it is fun!

Its kind of like ark mixed with Dragon warrior monsters/pokemon, and a few other things, It is fun, the creatures are cute, the world looks decent so far.

The art style is similar to what you'd expect from a present day creature collecting game.

I've only played singleplayer so far. But, i look forward to playing more of this game","Gameplay Enjoyment, Visual Appeal, Genre Comparison"

"Seriously fun game. Despite being an early access title, they've nailed all the core components of the game play to create a really satisfying loop that feels more complete than some AAA games on release. Definitely would recommend this game <3 some parts of it feel relatively incomplete, like a bit of a lacking story, but already with the first update you can tell the developers are really taking the feedback of the community seriously, improving game play and QoL within a month of release. Hopefully, that same kind of love given to the game by the devs continue, and we have a gem that spat in the face of an industry titan to produce something genuinely entertaining!","Gameplay Loop, Developer Responsiveness, Narrative Completeness"
Really gives pokemon vibe and graphics are also really good.Loved it.,"Aesthetic Vibe, Graphics Quality"
Overall surprisingly enjoyable.   The Pals make me laugh  how they help around the base.   Gets a little grindy but its not  onerous.    I did find it a bit  weird not to take fall damage.    I have  not encountered any bugs  if did  i  did not notice them.,"Entertainment Value, Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability"

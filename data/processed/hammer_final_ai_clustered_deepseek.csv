"CA really have brought things back around, from the disaster of shadows of change to the failure of leadership i really thought this game was gonna get shelved for a long time but they have shown signs that they want to rectify things. I have always enjoyed the total war games and this game truly is the magnum opus of total war, the sheer amount of content will let you play long into the night for nigh on years now if you wanted and always be ready to play more.","Consumer Value, Company Reputation, Game Longevity"

"Most of the negative review are related to bugs, and optimization issues. They are valid criticisms, however the game play is good, diplomacy is an upgraded version of 2, the races are all interesting, and the multiplayer is good now, and will be greater after a stability patch. All in all I recommend the game, but it definitely needs a patch or two.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Quality, Long-term Potential"

"An update broke the AI for a lot of factions, making them passive. This include TK and lizardmen, but not only (ogre spamming camp near one settlement and doing nothing too).

This allow other faction near it to expand more than intended, fully breaking the early, mid and end game balance depending on your starting position.

I suggest not buying solely because of this, and might change my review if they fix it in a timely manner (it's already been months, so it's looking quite bad, they clearly don't care and didn't bother testing because it's extremely obvious).","Technical Stability, Gameplay Balance, Developer Responsiveness"

"RoC could be better, but let's be real the main attraction for WH3 is the ""Immortal Empires"" combined map campaign.

WH3 suffers from what WH2 initially lacked, content prior to the release of Mortal Empires which in the grand scheme is a problem that solves itself.

Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! However if you are holding off until Immortal Empires drops that is a perfectly reasonable response.","Content Completeness, Consumer Recommendation, Long-term Value"

"I enjoy this game.

Review bombing it because of DLC cost - have you guys seen what DLC for other games cost? (e.g. Train Simulator Classic ... now that's kind of an extreme case, I'd never buy that one with its DLC scheme. There are many other games that I'd consider way too expensive for what they offer. Not this one here.)","Consumer Value, Price Comparison, DLC Cost Assessment"
"It runs like garbage. 


But it is super fun. 

The devs keep giving free content and changing previous paid content to be cheaper or easier to get, some having become free. 
You can also preview the paid for content in game to an extent.
I have almost 500 hour and over 2000 hours of the previous 2 titles, warhammer 2 and are are more like expansions rather than separate games with the biggest changes being graphical fidelity. 
The game is massive even with just the base game and no dlc. 
The game and dlc goes on special regularly and on good discounts if you want the extra content but do not want to pay full price for it.
I am of at the time of writing this have spent almost 35 hours in one campaign and in base there are a potential of 7 of them, not including the tutorial which is very impressive, or the big campaign.
There is also a big variety of mods available that makes the average to ugly female characters into the more lore accurate incredibly hot and attractive with mods to change units or characters into wearing skimpy clothing if the sjw aspects (it is a British game after all) are too much for you. Which can be found on the
steam workshop (Least amount of none sjw mods)
Nexus (high amount of none sjw mods)
Loverslab (No SJW mods)
The game is fantastic without mods to begin with, they just make the viewing experience if you like to zoom in and look at your units like i do, a much more pleasant and rewarding experience. Side note i placed almost 3000 hours before installing sexy mods so it isn't as important for the enjoyment of the game but the mediocre to ugly female models do get annoying after all that time.

Overall it is a fantastic game with hundreds of hours of content, mods to fix some bad or none lore accurate aspects, and specials to make up for the high amount of dlc that the game has.
I highly recommend it.","Technical Performance, Gameplay Enjoyment, Consumer Value & Content"

"Strategy gaming at it's finest! Many advancements and improvements over Warhammer 2, and I feel this is the zenith of Warhammer as it should be. Now, I'm not gonna go into the pricing of the DLCs, I'm just reviewing the vanilla game here.  

Regarding the siege battles; they are a bit too arcady for me and I much prefer Warhammer 2's sieges. I can't fault them for trying something new and mixing it up, but hopefully in a future patch they'll add the option of a Warhammer 2 siege battle cause right now it's too complicated and I auto-battle sieges. p","Gameplay Quality, Feature Comparison, Game Design Philosophy"

Just Total Warhammer 2 with very few new factions for full price. May as well just wait for 4 at this point.,"Consumer Value, Content Quantity, Series Progression"
"This game is a lot of fun, it is my first total war game ever and I have about 1200 hours on all TWWH games combined. So I have a decent amount of knowledge with the game both pros and cons.
Pros: 
1. Dwarfs, they're badass
2. Skaven (hehe funny rats)
3. Mod support is great
4. A lot of different races that all play differently and each sub-faction within those races that play different than others with campaign buffs, start positions, etc.
5. Battles are fun and engaging
6. Ever since WH3 dropped, CA has been receiving backlash and since the disaster that was Shadows of Change, CA seemed to have turned a new leaf with content. DLC can get a lil expensive but CA has been dropping a lot of free update content and they're going to continue to do so.
7. The AI is alright (at times)
Cons:
1. The AI is either alright or completely dumb. 
2. Difficulty is wonky imo. I'm the type of guy that prefers dumber AI the easier the difficulty is and vice versa. If you set it to a higher difficulty, the AI just gets stat buffs that kinda prevent certain styles of play (can't really go a melee army because of the damage buffs the AI gets)
3. Co-Op campaigning is easy to get desynced and disconnected. Idk if this has to do with my friend's connection or the game itself. One day it was working, the next day it wasn't. 
4. The game will randomly crash sometimes. Annoying to deal with but since the game autosaves after every turn it's whatever. 
5. Each TWWH game is a add-on to the previous game, so if you bought WH3 but didn't buy WH1 or WH2, you're locked out of 80% of the races until you buy those games, luckily you can get cheap copies off of Gee Two A.
6. Siege battles suck. The AI and my units can't path around properly during siege battles, and they're more of a grind than fun and engaging. 
7. Bretonnians (The French 🤢)
I recommend getting if you're into RTS games. Look for deals on Gee Two A since they're cheaper than buying it straight off of Steam.","Gameplay Variety, Content Value, Developer Support"

Hope you like paying 10-20 times what you spent on the game to unlock the rest of the content they released as piecemeal as possible to drain every last penny they could from you.

This is coming from a hardcore historical total war fan. I got bored of map painting and this something else .

"I am a large Total War fan, as well as a Warhammer fan. I have been with the Total War, Warhammer since the first one. I think that 3 is better then 1 overall, but is not yet better then the end product of 2, including all DLC. That being said, that makes Total War, Warhammer very good so far. I also find that the patches and patch notes are very comprehensive and regular. Their is a upcoming free patch coming that should expand the replay value. I look forward is going to come, as well I enjoy what is currently here.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Longevity, Developer Support"
"CA just said if we don't buy the new overpriced DLC + [strike]Troy 2[/strike] TW Pharaoh, they're gonna end support for Warhammer 3.

Honestly screw CA and screw SEGA. They've had some real lows in the past but this is a whole new layer of filth. They don't respect you or your wallet. I'm not paying their extortionate prices and neither should you. It's not our problem if they make stupid decisions, so why should we pay for it? 

Let Warhammer 3 crash and burn if that's what they really want. Don't worry CA, I'm sure [strike]Lawbreakers 2.0[/strike] HYENAS and Troy 2 are gonna do great!","Consumer Value, Corporate Ethics, Financial Pressure"
"Creative Assembly has been known for making good strategy games, however they have been steadily decreasing in quality and increasing in bugs. Warhammer Fantasy is a much loved franchise, and they for the most part do a good job of realizing the world and sturggles between factions.

However the game still has many bugs that go unaddressed while they continue to price gouge the dlc for ridiculous prices. Their is no good reason for these prices besides believing that you, the end user, are a complete mook and easily parted from your money.

If they focused more on balancing the game and fixing bugs rather than holding those necessary things ransom by insisting that you must purchase the same thing at a ridiculous price then its best to no longer support them. I do not recommend purchasing this game at full price or at all, and I also do not recommend buying any dlc for this game until they decide to lower the prices to what they were in previous games, if not lower than that to make up for their continual blunders.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Developer Practices"

"After 655 hours in the game, the updates are worse and worse. 
Each updates makes the game more unstable and more ressource consuming. 

The game needs proper fixes, you can't push small bug fixes for this game or ignore the bugs in the game.","Technical Stability, Resource Optimization, Update Quality"
"It pains me to make this, but at its current state I just could not recommend this game unless you are an insanely big Warhammer fan.

I feel as though the people who created the campaign were so focused on ""Doesn't it sound cool if X"" without thinking about how it would actually interact in the games format.  It completely goes against everything that made Total War fun to begin with.  Expanding, dominating, and growing your forces larger to take on all sorts of enemies as you conquer the map.

This isn't what happens at all in this game.  It actively punishes you for expanding by creating random chaos portals that spread corruption and armies across your entire empire while your (Likely) best army has screwed off somewhere else for the McGuffin.  3/4ths of my game is just sitting in a city and pressing the skip notification button until one of the portals opens back up to send a unit in.  If one of the other people in there just happen to get to the soul before you? Too bad, guess you gotta wait 20 turns again to try again.

And don't even get me started on these new Dominion battles.  I'm not sure who came up with the idea, but when I build an army of best units I have I want to have an epic battle with all that the enemy has to offer, not a Nascar endurance race of endless spawning enemies hitting you from behind the entire time you are advancing and from every single side endlessly basically making you ""Base Race"" till the end.  This may be a personal opinion, but these battles aren't fun...they are frustrating.

I have loved every Warhammer game, and many of the total war games.  They have their flaws, but also their charms.  Many of them came out with bugs and glitches (I'm looking at you Rome), but most have gotten better.  I sincerely hope that CA comes back around to fix this hot garbage of a campaign, or at least release Immortal Empires sooner rather than later.  I will gladly get rid of my negative review when it does.  Until then, I'm just going to go back to Warhammer 2 to get my fantasy fix.

Edit: As they have now updated the game with Immortal Empires I am flipping this review.  However OG campaign is still awful.","Gameplay Design, Consumer Value, Franchise Alignment"

"its a cool game but im tired asf from playing it so i'll keep this simple. The game itself is great and mechanics wise it stands above all the other ones in the series tho i have noticed a huge quality drop in performance after about an hour of playing. Could be because im playing on my laptop but its weird. Like i was able to play the game on medium graphics smoothly but then i come back from work and the quality drops to being in a cod lobby with 1300 ping. So needless to say, id recommend getting the game if your confident in your rig and if your not well, play at your own risk i guess.

After a while I understood that traversing the rifts is necessary to win and finally I understood. After that, the game became much more fun to play!

I would have loved to see something different.","Gameplay Mechanics, Learning Curve, Content Novelty"
"I have played total war for years. It is great to finally get a campaign that is more interesting than paint the map. To get a ""victory"" in the campaign, you must send your faction leader's army to chaos realms four times. This means rapid expansion is penalized which creates a fun dynamic. I want to expand enough to support a strong 2 army team, but not so much that I can't defend it with those two armies. This is a fun challenge, and it feels right lore-wise. Cathay wouldn't paint the map usually. The demonic factions always have to worry about being stabbed in the back. That's why a chaos invasion from the north is so rare - they cant trust each other. This campaign encourages more strategic thinking, it encourages the race (unlike WH2), and it fits the lore.

CA, stop being such greedy b****** and step up your game.
Also the amount of bug fixes, or rather lack of, is a joke. 4 months no updates. Bugs still being present from 8 years ago. 
But when they release one of their 4-6 months patches, then be rest assured, they introduce twice the amount of new bugs that they fixed.

A lot of features are all arcade mode cringe style even though total war games have a fan base that prefer realism. During sieges you can make wooden towers on the spot which makes no sense for a castle that already has stone towers. Why not have the towers already be built as stone and have it where you need to send soldiers and ammo to towers by spending the points? 
Cavalry can break down castle gates making siege rams totally pointless. The random rebel armies that spawn out of thin air can totally ruin campaigns. Siege towers are very easy to destroy by shooting at them and then the entire unit in the tower dies making it actually pointless to use siege towers because your units will die guaranteed. Gates have almost 0 health and can be knocked down in well under 30 seconds by some units. Not sure why these devs are having such a hard time with such simple concepts. There comes a point where its all just ridiculous. 

No chat box for multiplayer is unreasonably retarded and the multiplayer lobby for 1v1 and 2v2 etc is all yee yee jerry rigged. It doesn't take years to code a chat box with a report and block button.

"I absolutely love the total war Warhammer series. Even if you are not into Warhammer you will soon fall in love with all the different factions, armies and unit choices available. You end up spending far more money then you should on DLC's, because quite frankly some of them are amazing. 

I have spent hundreds of hours on this game, number 1 and 2 as well. Even more when they was available on game pass too. The amount of content you get with the base game is potentially hundreds of hours, and honestly it is amazing to watch thousands of cavalry demolish infantry at your control. 

Some of the best DLC's to purchase (which are regulary on sale) in my opinion are, Chaos Dwarfs, Wood Elves and the Ogre Kingdoms are loads of fun too. 

I used to love 40k as a child growing up, but never got into the fantasy side. After playing these games I have now re-started painting models after nearly 15 years off! I am obsessed with reading the old world books as well, and there is so much lore around the Warhammer fantasy.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Experience, Monetization Model"

"I really like the game, but unfortunately I have to give this a thumbs-down for one reason—the FPS. Compared to TW:WH2, it runs a LOT worse. With a bit of tweaking, I could get 120fps in that game, but in this, I just can't hit 60 unless I set everything to low. But doing that makes everything look like it was made out of play-dough by a 3rd grader, so I end up playing at basically 40 fps with frame dips or stutters turning the game into a slideshow.

It also seems to stutter a lot, clicking menus, building shit, opening skill trees, during battle... Basically doing anything aside from playing around in the main menu will cause a short stutter. No clue what the reason for this is, I have a pretty good cpu (i7 10700) and with msi afterburner I can see my usage is under 50% so...","Technical Performance, Comparative Quality, User Experience"

Personally, before purchasing I think you should wait for MORTAL EMIPRES. That way, you can play a combination of the previous three games in the series and also enjoy lots and lots of races along with the new ones. Perfect thing in my opinion. A crazy and beautiful game, and sure enough to come a long way but very surprising.","Gameplay Content, Technical Performance, Future Potential"

"I'll be straightforward with everyone and say I do recommend the game, but I do feel as if certain issues in the game needed to either changed/altered in my personal opinion. Here are some the issues I have with the game that I'd like to see either fixed or changed.

1) The rift mechanic I feel is ok at the beginning, but as more souls are collected either by AI or the player the corruption levels are too difficult to manage or dilute. This can cause players who are looking to expand their borders a difficult time as they need at least 2 armies at the ready to close these rifts to prevent a rise in rebellion or attempt to offset overwhelming corruption. Also when rogue daemon armies spawn with 5 to 8 Soul Grinders it can be disheartening or even discouraging to want to expand as not many garrisons can even attempt to damage these armies.

2) A rework to the Supporters system for Kislev, as I personally feel that after the confederation of the opposing faction, supporters have no further use. This is especially true for Boris as once you complete the unification of KIslev, they just sit there unused. If they could be used to spend on research, growth, bolstering defenses, negating corruption, or strengthening alliances I could see potential, but as of the current state again the system is useless.

3) Bel'akor, himself, needs to be more than a generic lord as he is the first Daemon Prince of the Chaos Gods. If he is to be a future FLC lord than hopefully flesh him out more

4) After you've beaten the game, I feel as the rifts should stop spawning as there is no point since Bel'akor is defeated. If you continue past the cutscene and hope for a normal TW campaign, then stop as the rifts continue and increase in frequency making it nearly not worth playing any further.

5) Ogres need a change on how they percieved as the current tech/hoard/skaven style isnt working personally. IMO they should be a combination of Vampire Pirates, where they themselves are the camps thats you improve, while also given the same food work around as skaven. Their current state makes them very difficult to play as you need to plan ahead of time where and camp goes and how far you can move before running back to camp to replenish your food stores before attrition damage takes effect.

6) This is a hot take and very personal opinion as I know a decent bit of lore of Old World Warhammer Fantasy and AoS, but  I feel that the inclusion of Chaos Lords to fill out the respective rosters is necessary. This being Archaeon in Chaos undivided, Sigvald with Slannesh, etc. This includes human chaos worshippers into the roster to fill them out such as Chaos Knights, chariots, and range. At the same time maybe including some AoS units that are unique to each Chaos God. Also changing the status of heralds to heroes to balance armies out. That way armies can have additional casters/champions to rely on in combat like VC

to revise on my experience, now that its playable.
the game is playable, still not perfect, but if you buy it on sale like i did its good. nothing special, and most certainly no wh2.
- my old review is below;



I have bought WH3, and the dlc for the ogre kingdoms and the realm of chaos. upon launching the game and playing the prologue, i got softlocked thrice (!) preventing me from completing a turn, these softlocks where a quest battle not spawning (the wolf of dervingard) another one where right after the 1st quest objective after the conquest of dervingard, the game refused to continue and gave me no indication as to why (this indication did not exist, and ive reloaded the game 5 times, on each softlock) fixing it became a possibility only if i returned to a safe before the quest battle. the third one was another quest battle, this time the one after before, where i was shown the prompt to press R to increase unit speed, but there was no movement for the unit and as such just as before, the same softlock with the same solution occured. then i tried to play the sandbox campaign (which i loved from wh2 and was very exited for) only to have it crash after turn 13 for reasons i do not know. my pc can run wh2 easily, and meets the requirements for this one too.

for these reasons i sadly cannot recommend this game, and instead will reccomend warhammer 2, which i do enjoy. a pity because i was looking forward to playing all the new factions and the expanded map.

ive requested the refund, but sadly i was over the time (6.5 hours as of now) due to how this game plays. hopefully i still get a refund, because this game is unplayable for me.

TL:DR:
cant play due to frequent crashes and frequent softlocks. Cannot recommend. hopefully i get my €60 euro back that i spend on this game and the dlc for it.","Technical Stability, Consumer Value, Comparative Quality"

"Editing my review as the game has received many updates since.  It plays quite well now but still loads slower and lags more than Warhammer 1 and 2, or any Total War for that matter.  The initial load takes several minutes but once in game it takes about 45s - 1m to load battles and about 25 seconds to load back to the campaign map.  Not amazing but far from unplayable.  Grand Campaign has so many factions now it's hard not to recommend as long as you have a beefy computer than can handle it.

Original review follows: I have a 3080 and compared to the first two games, this one is unplayable.  It lags and loads as if I'm playing on a 1060.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Especially if it's true that idiotic execs decided to punish players for legally purchasing their game.

DLC story packs from game 2 still not ported over and no peap on that. There should be a toggle to run in immortal empires. People payed for those.

Also, they have scrapped story content in the DLC and the cool trailers that get excited. We don't need cray things, but lke the sister of twighlight DLC, that was the gold standard for DLC and story in a DLC. 

Seiges are still a drag. Most of the seige maps are too big and u can't cover them. Game 2 seiges were better even. Only really the high elve seige maps are halfway ok. Feels more like mobile trash. 

1 DLC in the year. DLC have gone hugely down in quality. Another useless apolgoy, this game has gone to trash since the EA CEO came in a wreched it. Don't buy a thing from this company till they have new leadership and fix the train wreck. It sucks cause used to love their games.

"A very solid game in its current state, and the upcoming DLC looks promising.

Even though you need to buy the previous games and DLCs for the full(er) experience, even with just buying Total War: Warhammer III you can enjoy the game for the value you paid. Although you cannot play as the previous games' and DLCs' factions without purchasing those, you can still interact and fight against them with the starting races (Kislev, Cathay, Nurgle, Slaanesh, Khorne and Tzeentch + Be'lakor (Warriors of Chaos) in Immortal Empires).

It is very important to highlight, the Immortal Empires campaign combining the content of all three games is playable for owners of only Warhammer III as well.

The game is receiving FLC content and reworks with time, alongside the DLCs, so you are still receiving some new content if you are paying for the new DLCs or not.

Although the Warscape battle engine is always somewhat struggling in some way or form, it is rather polished, functional and enjoyable for the scope included in the Total War: Warhammer series.

The campaigns are quite enjoyable, with some exceptions, notably the late game feels rather dull and limiting in comparison to the earlier stages of campaigns because of the climate system and lack of a meaningful challenge. Scripted hostile armies spawning in completely secured territory through end game scenarios is not an enjoyable late game challenge.

With all this said, especially if you also buy the other games or DLCs you are interested in, you will have a blast in the first 100 or so turns of most of your campaigns.

From the campaigns I've played, I especially recommend playing as Katrin (Kislev) and Wulfrik the Wanderer (Norsca - paid DLC from the first game) in the Immortal Empires campaign, and I'm looking forward to a Karl Franz (Empire) campaign in the upcoming 5.0 version of the game. The Realms of Chaos campaign is not bad by any means, but the Immortal Empires campaign offers a more clean and varied fun experience.

As a conclusion, I recommend this game and I hope it will continue to receive support and new content in the years to come.","Consumer Value, Content Accessibility, Long-term Support"

"Only tech issue i had was some blurriness, which was resolved by changing anti-alias method.

The new factions are good fun, been getting lots of fun out of it, and there are many many improvements over WH2 overall.
To the point that i wouldn't be able to go back if i wanted to (Alliances, Quick Diplomacy, Reinforcement timers, Actual Settlements, settlement trading ect)

BUT, the Realm of Chaos campaign itself is very annoying. You'll get rifts spawning every 30 turns, that spew out armies agents and corruption, and you get no rewards when doing the main story, which leaves you little incentive to do so a second or third time.

The optimal way to ""Win"" is just capture a province or two, and just end turn until you get the rifts.

Because you are penalised if you try to expand. the only way to deal with rifts en-masse is to spam heros. and sit them at the rift spawns. which is incredibly tedious, and closing each rift costs 1500 gold if you do it this way, so it gets quite expensive.

To add to this, the AI is TERRIBLE at dealing with rifts. to the point that the entire map except your territory becomes the chaos wastes, making it even more tedious due to attrition...

REALLY keen on mortal empires, but  overall it's still a massive improvement,
Just not sure why they went for such a tedious and unrewarding main campaign. at least i could ignore the vortex.","Technical Performance, Gameplay Content & Features, Campaign Design & Incentives"

It's stupid. It's dumb. It's anti-fun. There is no more strategy or thinking involved when all you are doing is swatting down stacks the enemy can respawn by CHEATS within 2 turns. It just becomes a game of tricking the AI into positioning their stack within striking distance of your 2 stacks and then it's repeat 20-30-4000 times.

"I made the jump from Total War Warhammer 2 to 3 more out of curiosity than necessity. 2 is a very fine game I have sunk over a hundred hours in, and wasn’t really looking for change. But, when Immortal Empires was released I thought it was time to start the Wood Elves playthrough I always wanted to do and the new hotness was too hard to resist. 

And now I can never go back. 

It’s not just the gigantic new map with the eight new and all the old factions to fight. It’s definitely not the campaign I haven’t even started yet and that I hear so much bad things about. It’s all the little and not so little gameplay improvements that were added, all of them belonging to the category “I didn’t know I needed this, but now I can never give it up”. 

The reworked diplomacy system finally clearly communicates why certain offers are always going to be denied. The ally system allows for an even greater variety in army composition without changing the character of the faction armies too much. The millions of little changes to the battle systems make it so much easier to navigate the great battles and pull off some really stunning reversals at times. The late game crisis events that have the potential to shake up the end game grind. And, yes, the metric tons of new content helps a lot, too. 

Meanwhile the core gameplay loop is the same addictive power fantasy it always was. The production values are as atmospheric as before. Hopefully the commitment to the game by the studio will be as exemplary as it has been in the past, too. With one very substantial DLC pack already out, it sure looks that way. 

This game is a substantial improvement over Warhammer 2, without losing any of its essence. If you liked that one, absolutely go get this one.","Gameplay Evolution, Content Expansion, Feature Enhancement"

"Hands down my favorite game (and trilogy). I never write reviews, but I felt I had to for this one because I've already sunk a lot of time in it and plan on sinking even more as time goes on.

Realm of Chaos Campaign:
It's good for a play through of whatever factions you find interesting. The story picks up from the prologue so be sure to play it even if you're a total war veteran (don't worry, it's actually REALLY nice). While it's the main selling point of the game the real meat and potatoes is....

Immortal Empires:
If you own game 1 and 2, you get access to Immortal Empires, which is a gigantic world map with ALL factions from ALL three games in it available to play. If the faction is a DLC, you must own the DLC, obviously. This is where the game truly shines and provides thousands of hours of playtime. As of writing there's a total of 86(!) playable Legendary Lords (factions). You want to paint the world map with your colors via world domination? Create an alliance superpower? Rid the world of the evil Chaos factions? Rid the world of Order factions as the Chaos factions? Assert Elven supremacy as the High elves? This is where you do it.

As per Total War, the secret sauce is the enjoyable mix of a turn-based strategy on the campaign map (where you move armies, do diplomacy, etc.) and real time battles. No other game to my knowledge does this as well as Total War.

Couple all this with the fantastic universe that is Warhammer Fantasy and this game is just..*chef's kiss*. As a Warhammer fan, this game has been a dream for decades.

The game did launch a bit rocky (Realm of Chaos campaign) but was fixed and changed a bit according to player feedback.
There are also some bugs that the devs are aware of, specifically in the Immortal Empires which is why they label it as a Beta. They are constantly tweaking and fixing issues that crop up as they create a truly massive and one of a kind experience.

The modding community is fantastic, with hundreds of mods available to suite your specific tastes and needs.

With the amount of content available for this game (and more coming every 3-6 months), the price is well worth it if you are at all a total war fan, Warhammer fan, or fantasy fan.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Content, Narrative Integration"

If you enjoyed 1 and 2 you will probably enjoy this one too, but it is an expensive game with all DLC and if you compared the full price to what you are actually getting than it isn't worth it.

"The core gameplay is still good, just as in TW:WH2, New units are fun and the new race mechanics introduced (Food, Chaos devotion etc.) are also solid and playable. 
But the main Campaign mechanic is incredibly unfun, in some aspects downright unfair and massively decreases replayability. Even races which shouldn't care about Ursun (Ogres and Cathay) are forced into the Chaos Realm Mechanic, which continuosly hogs your main army. Because the AI has an unfair advantage in the chaos realms in some aspects, you can't just ignore this main mechanic. This decreases replayability with other races, because your win conditions are always the same. 
Add on this the instability of the game (Alt+Tab can crash it, currently it crashes often when you want to resolve a Battle manually) and it can't be recommended in its current state.

"###Update3### - A mere 12months later and CA are back to their old ways and leaving the game in a broken state while they get ready for more paid DLC. Seems like we will never reach the peak experience from TWWH2.

Won't be buying any future Total War games if this game is the standard for how they treat there flagship titles.

###Update2### - CA through some frequent updates over the last 6months have tried to win back some community favour with bug fixing and content updates to previously sold DLC. It's a nice gesture and while i feel like the game is in a good place i fear the damage to community has been done. I would recommend the game now in it's current state, however i don't believe this game will reach it's original potential of being the greatest warhammer total war in the series so. That title still appears to be held by it's predecessor.

###Update1### - So the game has been out for over a year and a half now and while the released content for the game has been very good, CA seem to have abandoned fixing any long term bugs in this game in place for releasing what is now over priced DLC for small amounts of content.

In addition to the lack of bug fixing and to justify the DLC prices CA have come out in a blog post and basically said ""buy the dlc or we take the game in the backyard shoot it in the face and bury it next to Three Kingdoms"".

In CA eyes, they realises that currently there are enough 'whales' in the community with money that just take the 'shut up and take my money' approach and buy all their DLCs regardless of price at this point. i'm looking at this game now and feel disgusted at the level CA have gone to for financial gain at the expensive of their fans. But while there blog post to justify this is shameful and tone deaf, I still don't expect CA will change this process until the long term effects of this are fully realised from a financial perspective. The community is in uproar about the blog post response to these pricing concerns and rightly so and in the long term its going hurt CA, their business, the fans and the future dlcs and other total war releases. I've been playing total war games and loved them for a very long time, but will be taking my money and time elsewhere if things don't change and i expect the other total war  fans will eventually move on to other games and some will never return. 

###Original thoughts at release###
Great potential here, but flawed at release after being a major step back from the previous game in almost every aspect, The recent patch and update (DLC) is a step in the right direction so if that trend continues with future patches and updates there will be a very good game here in the next 4-6 months. Until then i'd recommend sticking with Total War: Warhammer 2 if you have that as that games experience is still exceptionally better than what this game has to offer.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Developer Accountability"

"Well......I certainly got MY money's worth out of the game but as a new player trying to get in....dang it really is a lot of money, sort of like a Paradox game with a million DLCs. I bought all this stuff drips and drabs over the last 8 or 9 years. But to buy this all at once? Yeesh. You will want the first two games as their content all snowballs into this title; meaning the races introduced in the first two games and whatever dlcs you picked will be playable right out of the box in addition to the warhammer 3 base factions if you buy this game (you don't need to keep warhammer 1 and 2 installed at least, thank goodness). If you don't own either of the first two you will only get the base warhammer 3 factions. As such, I can really only recommend this game on sale simply because there is just so much to buy. A good chunk of the DLC factions ARE pretty good too.

 The modding scene is really good on these games and I HIGHLY recommend the SFO mod. Just filter by ""top rated all time"" in the workshop and there's easily 5-10 pages of 5 star mods to look at. SFO is a great one-stop compilation though, doesn't add a bunch of useless fluff for the sake of adding it either; its all tasteful stuff in my opinion. Theres a lot of modded races you can add as well if you can't afford the DLC factions. Cataph's mods, Mixu's faction unlocker, Immortal Empires Expanded, The Old World Campaign, SCCP additional factions, OVN Lost factions. Hell there's a mod to be a nation of giant crabs. Get the Better Camera mod too, thank me later.

So what of the actual gameplay? These games takes place in two distinct spheres; the campaign map and the battlefield. The campaign map is a turn-based affair where you will manage your towns by constructing buildings in your allotted building slots, the number of which are governed by your population size/growth. So you have to decide do you want buildings that produce trade goods versus expanding the types of troops you can recruit as an example. Your towns themselves have to have their public order managed on a sliding scale of -100 to +100, and many factions have a corruption type and environment that they naturally spread/prefer to kinda terraform the land to their liking in a way which is pretty interesting. A couple of towns together in pre-determined geographic areas make up ""provinces"" and once you control all towns in a province you can issue an edict to give that whole province a buff. The capital town/city of each province can become bigger and have more building slots and get better defensive walls and higher-tier units. On the campaign map you will also recruit troops which go into army ""stacks"" that must be headed by a ""lord"". Each troop stack can have 20 units, including the Lord. These stacks can be moved around the map and even enter different stances so you can force-march them to get a bit more movement range, a raiding stance to steal gold or food in enemy territory, an ambush stance in difficult terrain to get the jump on the enemy......stuff like that. You can research technologies and engage in diplomacy with different tabs on the campaign map. You can also level up and equip gear to the Lords leading your armies.

When your stack(s) bump into enemy stacks, a pitched battle on that physical spot of earth takes place in that the game will send you through a loading screen and then into a whole other half of the game where you assume command of your military stack in real-time and guide them to victory. This is really where the Total War franchise has always stood out; offering battles the scale of which no other games really even get close too. Your units that you built and shoved in here? Oh yea, ONE unit might be 120 dinosaur-men wielding axes or spears. Another unit might be just one guy but its a whole entire dragon at your command. Maybe you built some sick siege equipment. Some factions get some crazy ish like warp lightning cannons (great for taking out aforementioned dragons heh) and my personal fave: Hellstorm Rocket batteries lolol. You can have FORTY units on screen under your command at once and thats not even including whatever the enemy is throwing at you so you could easily have 6000 - 8000 models on screen at once all INDIVIDUALLY fighting each other to where you can zoom in to their perspective on the ground and watch them fight and see their individual animations. It's insane. Zooming in to watch your undead Cairn Wraiths, ghost mfers with scythes riding skeleton horses, charging in to a flank and just demolishing some poor infantry unit. Or watching the previously mentioned siege equipment bombarding the enemy from their own perspective never gets old. In a rather loose way; its a rock, paper, scissors formula in that spearmen beat cavalry, cavalry beat infantry that dont have spears, missile units tear up anything until something gets in their face, heavy infantry can beat most other things once they bog them down enough but can be flanked and beaten by other things. Flying units are generally susceptible to missiles but scare the piss out of infantry when they land and start whooping ass. But then again.....this game has so many factions with weird niche exceptions and specialist units that its a little more complicated than that. You'll get the hang of it. It can be quite a bit to manage because on top of all these units....your Lords have special abilities and you may have a mage or two in your stack that can straight up cast spells. 

I could go on all day about this game. Graphics are good, performance is good untill you break the game with so much crap on screen it slows everything down lol. Audio is good for sound effects and forgettable for actual music. The faction variety gives a ton of replayability because of their wildly differing unit rosters and faction mechanics that have gotten better and better over time from Warhammer 1 until now.

Two last points. First, I have had an enormous amount of fun playing multiplayer co-op campaigns and if you have a good friend, or THREE who will spend the time with you, its friggin awesome. You all take your turns simultaneously now which is a huge improvement over warhammer 1 and 2. When your buddy wants to fight a battle on the battle map, they can gift you units to control so you all can actively participate and not sit there bored. Its actually a great way to learn to mico units by having your friend give you just the spellcasters or just the cavalry to manage. 

Last point; USE THE FOLLOWING DIFFICULTY SETTINGS!!!! For Campaign difficulty set it to easy or medium to learn the game. But for the battles, you should set it to Normal or Hard. It is crucial you DO NOT EVER SET BATTLE DIFFICULTY TO EASY! Why? Because it doesn't actually change the difficulty of the AI, all it does is make your auto-resolve battle option ridiculously easy by effectively multiplying the power of your army by a factor of 2.5 or 3....why is this bad? Because then when you go try to fight a battle yourself, you no longer get that multiplier, it ONLY applies to how your auto-resolved battles will go. This means, that as a new player you will get a worse result commanding the battle yourself EVERY TIME and discourage yourself and/or resign yourself to NEVER commanding any of the battles, meaning you effectively miss out on learning HALF OF THE GAME! Note; Normal battle difficulty has this problem as well but less so, it gives you like a 30 or 40 percent strength calculation for auto-resolves. Thus the recommended battle setting is actually HARD so the auto-resolve calculator finally tells you the damn truth about your chances commanding it yourself.

EDIT: I'm changing my review to negative until you idiots at CA fix the AI bug making multiple factions sit around and do nothing. Unacceptable by this point in the game's life cycle and unacceptable for a company making similar games for 20 years. And eff you for making LegendofTotalWar upset.","Consumer Value, Financial Accessibility, Content Integration"

"This game offers more content than TWWH2, but all of it less polished and feels worse. Units are unresponsive, bugs are everywhere, performance is terrible. The new Realms of Chaos campaign is godawful and led to the game being panned on release; it has since recovered due to Immortal Empires, which is massive but a much less tight experience than Mortal Empires in TWWH2.

"Hit and miss but over all a good game with lots to hopefully look forward to in the future.

The campaign is much improved from it's state at launch but still can be extremely frustrating at times and is far worse for some factions that others. Siege battles however are a massive improvement over Total Warhammer 2, not the best they have ever been in a total war game but the best they have been for a while. The factions are all quite fun and different with there own interesting mechanics but at the moment there is a a definite lack of variety compared to it's predecessor.

Fun to play especially with friends but it's got a way to go before it will be as enjoyable as Total Warhammer 2 hopefully the immortal empires update will change all that though.","Gameplay Experience, Content Variety, Multiplayer Enjoyment"

"Greedy, incompetent company that are out of touch and overvalue themselves.

They took the money that their most loyal customers for their most niche market (which they have monopolised) have paid without question, and wasted big part of it on something that they have never done before: online battle royale shooter with loot boxes.

This would've been fine if CA had track record of fixing the issues and not be slimy with their corporate greed that is so bad that even their parent company had to put a stop to a train wreck of the project.
Company thinks they are a super star, a hot shot, big boss, or whatever they are, yet they are nothing but a shell of its former glory, all built with the genre that they have full grasp.

Clearly it seems like Sega held the management to be in charge of laying off their 40% of work force and they just decided to lay off those that do not fit with their agenda.

Of course Total War community is not a group of angels, it is full of toxic people that can't seem to grasp the idea of common sense, and hide behind incognito to do some heinous shit to anyone that may have involvement with CA. However, the way they have been handling many of their issues have been down right atrocious and current drama is basically the last straw that broke the camel's back.

DO NOT buy this or ANY games from Creative Assembly, but if you are really inclined to do so, I would be very careful about it. This company has shut down the support of games that are extremely popular (3K total war), shut down the communication of any valid criticism and run their mouth about how it is a ""privilege"" for a PAYING CUSTOMERS to critique their game.
In addition, they have been up-charging their products, like DLC, Total War Sagas all the while their technical debt on each game is constantly increasing with every patch.","Consumer Value, Corporate Ethics, Product Direction"

Let me reiterate, a game 1 faction, that has never been majorly updated outside of balancing, is still not receiving any rework or planned overhaul. 

Their tech tree is useless, their confederate mechanic is useless (because many norscan tribes are vassalized by WoC factions), their monster hunt feature offers awful rewards so it's pointless even doing it, and their devotion system is an utter waste of time. 

They have a limited roster, 2 LL, and each campaign consists of the same ""getting pinned in Norsca"" even though Wulfrik is supposed to be WANDERING

It's been 6 YEARS since they were released, and for the longest time you couldn't even play them on the second game.

"I have played since shogun 2. Know whats changed since then? Very little and thats kind of the motto with CA. 

Do as little as possible because you have no competitors. It used to be the way that new games changed the formula in some interesting way. Advances in tec had developers constantly pushing limits to make bigger and better games, improvements to the formula and new things to play with. If you guys played company of heroes, lets just think about how in COH2 they added ice that you could blow up to sink tanks. what did CA do? Well in Attila you could set buildings on fire during sieges. 

But for the longest time, you STILL can't fully destroy castle walls, theirs always an invulnerable nub of the wall left standing. 
God forbid you man your walls in a siege because telling your units to get off the wall takes them 5 business days. 
Units aren't responsive. God forbid you tell your handgunners to shoot something to the side of them, they'll think about it and instead of just turning and shooting the whole damn unit moves and then gl gg if they decide they dont want to shoot.
You can't put cannons on the walls still. 
The pathing is still trash, a bunch of archers running the opposite direction to your horses? Sounds like the exact thing cavalry was made for, except instead of running them over and moving on with their day they engage the back row and slow down because now the entire 60 horses are in ""Combat"". 
Flying units suck because the annoying sync animations don't really favour flying units. 
Large units getting stuck on 1 enemy because yes mr player I know you want your Godzilla to run over there but this spear man is on double pay. 
Difficulty is still just cheats for the AI, nothing interesting to see here. 
End game crisis? lol. Instead of something thematic and interesting like oh idk, Stellaris? You get a million armies spawn out of thin air with the most annoying army comps. Destroyed the vampire counts did you? Well lets just spawn them back in around their old capitol that you arent defending. That's fun and totally makes sense instead of.. Spawning them in for the factions still alive?

Most of these issues have been here since Rome 2 and frankly I gave up after Attila because it was already stale. It's simple CA, your next game better have a brand new engine or you can bet your bottom dollar i'm not buying it and if you care about getting good games that are worth your hard earned money and the overall health of the RTS gaming scene you wont buy it either.","Historical Progression, Gameplay Innovation, Competitive Market Dynamics"

TWW3 is just a DLC tbh. It brings nothing new to the table, and it has so many visual and/or game-breaking bugs, that it feels unplayable.

- The faction armies are, of course, wildly different, creating interesting asymmetry in every game

And, of course, simultaneous turns and up to 8 players is a GAME CHANGER
Total War multiplayer campaigns have always been a slog waiting for the other player's turn to end, so WH3 with friends (even just 1 friend) feels so much punchier

"I own every game in the franchise, nearly 1200 hours across the three Warhammer games and I would say that Total war has and will be my forever games. 

That being said this toxic pricing model, the cold messaging put out by the developers, and the lack of content for $25 dollars is insulting to someone like me and probably you reading this who has stood by this company through the good and bad times. 

Avoiding politics because its dumb the worlds economy is hurting in every country right now and gaming is an outlet that many people like myself turn too for some solace. 

For this company to recognize that and claim ""higher operating costs"" as a reason for almost doubling the price of a lord pack  that has half the content per lord followed by a veiled threat to brick the game is a slap in my face. I will not be buying this DLC and I own every DLC they have put out for the last 8 years.

"Hello there, let me tell you why this ""review bombing"" is justified after 18 months of lousy product support:

    Campaign map AI utterly sucks, unable to put up a proper fight, build/upgrade up its armies or effectively develop its empires.
    Diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy AI in all ways & forms is beyond awful, especially around vassals and alliances
    AI is bugged/limited in its perception of nearby faction (AI is literally not aware what factions are nearby [no diplomatic contact]).
    unit pathing in manual battles, especially cities with construct-able barricades, is awful
    units refusing to path through broken city gates & destroyed city walls, instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up & exhaust themselves.
    cavalry/monsters getting models stuck, which pulls back the whole unit into death.
    units dropping/forgetting orders, even in the middle of pitched melee combat
    units not shooting because they are ""moving fast"" while being stationary
    units unable to shoot despite having clear Line Of Sight
    battle maps being broken for pathing and LOSight, especially on top of wall crenellations
    auto-resolve insists on damaging & killing Single-entity-monsters and especially artillery pieces, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1.
    auto-resolve still gives cities a ridicilous advantage, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1.
    certain units & lords/heroes fail to properly do their charging attack
    units (especially large ones) will randomly die when attacking certain walls/gates, or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall (but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger).
    units (even lords on foot) will randomly die when climbing ladders.
    some lords (cathay dragons especially) just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time.
    AI does not understand nor properly react during the defense of siege battles, it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force.
    AI charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death, especially lords/heroes like Belakor
    AI clueless about properly using AOE magic & magic in general, which also makes anything ""anti magic"" rather useless
    hundreds of bugs related to skills, techs, items, unit abilities/stats, building mechanics etc etc.
    sometimes two characters (lords/heroes) will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map, permanenetly preventing them from movement and interaction.
    Item qualities being nonsense, with common ones often being better than rare/special ones.
    lord/hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones.
    WOChaos revive norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by CA because they could not be bothered to properly fix it.
    Manual battle AI will sometimes simply not activate, instead its units refuse to attack/defend/move. Seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defense battles.
    Countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords/heroes do not work properly
    AI occasionally able to see your ambush/hidden armies from across immense distances & react to their positioning
    skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger/react, causing the ranged unit to just stand still
    AI will often prioritize targeting, sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction.
    player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership/fleeing unit, especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord.
    squads of large-sized ranged units (like salamander/razordon hunting packs) after finishing a move order will take forever to ""wiggle around"" before actually firing
    confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics (skaven etc) will often start at zero loyalty.
    confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts
    confederated Legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait, meaning their next death is permanent.
    Completely non-functional mechanic for automatic development of cities (everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked)
    AI lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes, which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation.
    bugs related to construct-able objects on defensive maps, where units get stuck in barricades or can not attack them
    fresh bugs like bretonia damsels, wood elf ariel, nakai unit recruitment etc etc.
    Black Ark unique map army spawn positions AGAIN bugged, after it was fixed in late Tww 2
    Black Ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby DElf armies bugs out when the Black Ark is garrisoned in a city.
    AI will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly (but not yet at war) factions which are still surrounding that location (from the previous turns razing).
    AI will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force (instead of fighting where its chance is best, inside the capitol).
    some sea objects (like islands/treasure/skull/carcass) will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop
    AI will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering & overpowering the garrison 5 to 1, and auto-resolve showing certain defeat for the players city.
    various lord/hero equippable ancillaries that fail to work properly
    Vampire Count/Coast UI for showing raise dead pool possibilities (near city bar UI) does not show units recruit-able from battle casualties.
    certain unique Cathay Caravan rewards are again inaccessible, despite being ""fixed"" in some previous patch (such as the vampire weapon).
    there is a limited number of names for generic lords/heroes, and once they have all been used up the game notifications will start showing nonsense (mixing up factions, names & icons etc).

"Its Warhammer plain and simple. if you liked Warhammer 1 and Warhammer 2 Total War you will love the third installement. it improves on almost all aspects from the first 2 installements in the series. from the units to magic to the connectivity in multiplayer matches or campaigns. 8 player simultanious campaigns is a step in the right direction in almost every way and i hope that it continues for future titles in the total war series.
Now why am i giving it a negative review? Well its mostly due to issues that i have had with this series since the first installement. DOOM STACKS everywhere, to win you need doom stacks of the same 1-2 units with the same buffs over and over again. i personnally dont find such army compositions fun or interesting. 
I also dislike the Magic in the game. i completely get that its part of Warhammer in every way, i just dont like using it nor having it used on me. i feel it breaks the possibility of trying to use tactics in combat when random chunks of meteors just spawn out of the sky. As I've said above i get its part of warhammer and i was willing to live with it but tie that with the Doom Stacks meta and i just can't.
ever since Immortal Empires has been released ive tried playing my favorite faction, the Dwarves. Can i just say they have Fucked it up hard. the book of Grudges is completely broken. on turn 1 with every Dwarven faction ive played they start with 8+ Grudges scattered across the map. after about 20 turns your already losing a lot of public order in your lands due to the grudge system. It forces you to try and rush targets that will completely overextend you in every way. not to mention most Grudges are on settlements of other major factions. 

Yes my review here is basically me just being mad at aspects that have been a part of the Warhammer series since Warhammer 1. i was usually able to ignore most of these issues and having a blast in MP. I am unable to Ignore them now and it completely kills any enjoyment i have tried to have with this game.","Gameplay Balance, Series Evolution, Multiplayer Experience"

"User: Haza 2/17/2020

Hello, I'm a big fan of the franchise, in particular the Warhammer series. I think they are great games, and you all did a fantastic job translating that fun and interesting setting into a video game.
I have been wondering, though, why are all the humans white or Chinese in the games as of now? I understand that the setting was centered on the Old World. And I don't expect any halfhearted diversification of, say, the Empire or Bretonnia; Obviously, it wouldn't make sense in the setting and probably just ** off the fascists in the GW fanbase.
But I am curious if the lack of racial diversity within human factions is something you've thought of, something which concerns you, or something you plan to change in the future? As a non-white gamer and fantasy lover, I've always been disappointed by how white the most popular fantasy universes are. Be it Warhammer or LoTR, they center white people as the baseline for what ""human"" means, and often have those white people fight races of inhuman monsters and corrupt men who may or may not be based on racist real world stereotypes (the Easterlings and Haradrim in LoTR; the Skaven, to me, could read as an analog for the Nazi's perceptions of jews infiltrating society with criminal conspiracies).
Of course, I know you all didn't create these worlds, but, given the increasingly global nature of the Warhammer games, I would really like to see more human factions based on African or Middle eastern cultures. Perhaps something like a Wakanda-like nation taking the fight to Chaos.
I recognize it could be hard to make respectfully, seeing as what I know of the original GW lore portrays these cultures in a way that's often a little stereotypical... but given the ridiculousness of the setting I don't think it would be too hard to adjust and expand the canon so that it is respectful, but still over-the-top and fun, like Bretonnia and the Empire.
I know that this is a just a videogame, and not that important in the grand scheme of things. But I think there was an excellent opportunity in game 3 to subvert the, in my view quite harmful, trope of ultra-whiteness/eurocentrism in high fantasy.","Narrative Authenticity, Representation & Inclusivity, Franchise Fidelity"

What a wasted opportunity. While there are less bugs, the gameplay has actually worsened in my eyes since launch. It's really sad as what should have been a great final chapter to a wonderful series just sputters out.

Fantastic culmination of the series. A little hard to adjust to after the smorgasbord that is Mortal Empires, but 3 is a good game in its own right. And will become even better after the eventual release of Immortal Empires

Currently the only thing to complain about is the poor state of sieges, and some odd UI changes.

It took a VERY long time but the game is stable. The monetization is by creative assembly so you should only go in when it's on a mega sale to grab all previous factions and games.

"Changing my review from negative to positive. Almost a year later, Warhammer III is finally enjoyable as a game. The release of immortal empires changed everything from the get go, even if it was a little bit of a mess starting out. Many months later, the game runs much better, feels better to play, and is quite satisfying to paint the gigantic map that is the completed Old World. The barrier to new players has been dropped by allowing IE access without buying a million DLC. It seems that after some quite intense backlash and drama, CA is finally listening to the community.

All this to say, while the development process is slow and sometimes tedious, this game is on it's way to surpassing Warhammer II. The replay-ability is already there with dozens of Legendary Lords to play. There are some factions that need some updating/reworking (Dwarfs, Dark Elves, Ogres, Demon Prince/Daniel, Kugath, etc.)... But as it stands every faction is a viable pick. It's a fun game, and if you are a fan of total war or are even slightly interested in Warhammer fantasy, I can confidently recommend TWW3, especially on sale!","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Long-term Development"
"if you've played other total war games, its that but with warhammer fantasy units. theres nothing too special about the mechanics or anything.

By far the worse DLC model for a video game every. you have to buy the games and DLC from the other 2 games to be able to play other factions. Imagine if you had to buy every arma game to play arma 3, or every counter strike game to unlock all of the weapons in CSGO.

Most horrid shit ive ever seen in my life. I play paradox interactive games and this genuinely baffled me.","Consumer Value, Business Model, Comparative Industry Standards"

"Update Feb 25: Alright they got there. Still not as good as the underlying game play of Pharaoh but worth the buy.

Update August 2023: later patches introduced new bugs. I haven’t touched the game in months. I wish I could recommend it. 
—
Patch has resolved mymain issues.  I'm ok to recommend the game as it stands as of Patch 1.31 (July 2022).
---
This game is pretty incredible.  The factions are well thought out.  The map and battles are gorgeous.  

BUT the overarching campaign is not very fun. You hardly get to use your faction leader, because they're always stuck in some hellhole, taking attrition, to move the story forward.  When you finally get to it, the end battle is not auto-resolvable and way too punishing, even on the easiest setting, despite all battles leading up to this one being fairly straightforward, either via auto resolve or by fighting manually.  There are enough bugged collisions where units get stuck on defense structures, and you absolutely need them to win, so they sit there, dying slowly, while you can do nothing. It's hard to tell if this battle is so hard because of faction imbalance - maybe my army structure wasn't suited for the final battle - but if that's the case, why was this army melting everything else it faced? Poor design.

Worse yet, the 'intercept faction about to win' thing seems to be bugged, so you just lose, despite getting a warning that you're about to lose and need to fight. And if you lose the campaign because another faction beats you in this dumb race, there's no option to play on.  

Great game concept, totally ruined by the forced end game where its central features are bugged.  I can't overstate how frustrated I am by the mechanics of the campaign and the 'survival battle' concept.  So, so misguided. Now I'll probably walk away for a day and try again, only to come back and deal with the same issue...just like last time.

So, wait for a big patch or two to solve these issues.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Experience, Content Quality"

The factions (for chaos/evil) are really cool, interesting, and flavorful! I am the type of player, I struggle enjoying the ""good guys"" even in TW2.

With all of this said, there is more debugging and Quality of Life improvements to get the A.I up to code with where warhammer total war 2 currently is. Remember when considering this game, the second has years worth of development into it after hitting market and this has months so far. They cannot copy/paste everything into this game esp with all the great updates they did!  What that means though, is that they have devs that already know how to fix those problems, so in time this game will be ABSOLUTELY INSANE! My rating for the current state of the game without comparison is 8/10, and 6/10 with comparison.  The moment they fix the AI and minor bugs, the game will be easily 9.5/10. Then if they get all the previous factions with the new mechanics 10/10, redefining moment for the genre!

"This game was a mess at launch. The original campaign for the game(""Realms of Chaos"") is just as awful and borderline unplayable today as it was on launch. The community largely overlooked this with the release of the grand campaign tying all three Total War: Warhammer games together. 

Bugs have been many, and patches have been few and far between. Many things are plagued by horrible design decisions(such as the campaign mechanics for the Ogre Kingdoms) and haven't even been touched since launch a year and half ago. 

For many, the gigantic 150% price hike for the forthcoming Shadows of Change are too much, and I agree. In some ways it is offering us less content than DLC that have released earlier at less than half the price. Creative Assembly and Sega are not serious about improving the game. They are not serious about revisiting bad design decisions, fixing bugs, or even giving quality content in paid DLC. This is about the most cynical price gouging I've seen in a game in many years.

The most recent update (5.0) has finally got the game into a good state, and the latest DLC accompanying it is one of the best they've made for the series.

The game still has its issues (mostly revolving around the AI and lack of interesting end game), but they only really become noticable once you've got hundreds of hours in the series, by which point you'll have gotten more than your money's worth.

If you've been holding off on getting game 3, it's definitely worth picking up now.

"[b]Total War: Warhammer III - A Mixed Experience with a Recommendation[/b]

Rating: ★★★☆☆

Total War: Warhammer III presents a mixed experience that may appeal to dedicated fans of the series but may not be worth it for everyone. With its continuation of the grand strategy and fantastical battles, this game offers some enjoyable moments, but falls short in certain areas.

While the game maintains the immersive Warhammer universe and introduces new factions, it lacks significant innovation compared to its predecessors. The campaign can feel repetitive and lacks enough fresh mechanics to keep players fully engaged.

However, if you can find Total War: Warhammer III at a discounted price, particularly under $20, it may be worth considering for fans of the series. Despite its flaws, it still offers the iconic battles and strategic depth that the franchise is known for.

Overall, if you are a dedicated fan of the Total War series and can acquire the game at a lower price point, Total War: Warhammer III may be worth a purchase. However, for those looking for groundbreaking improvements or a completely new experience, it may not be worth investing in at full price.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Innovation, Series Continuity"
"Somehow, CA thinks it is a privilege for us to use a public forum to tell them they have more rot and corruption than a Nurgling with super AIDS. This is not even to mention the absolutely unfair and unjustified DLC price gauging that has been going on for years now while they can't even fix basic problems in the base game. 
Unless there is a top down restructuring of this company, and until all the rot has been cut out, I will never buy another CA product, game, or DLC. I would encourage anybody else reading this review to do the same.  They do not deserve our money.","Consumer Value, Corporate Ethics, Technical Stability"
"Update 10/6/25: I have decided that CA has had too many chances in general and I'm giving up this series. A fair warning to anybody looking to get into this series, Creative Assembly does not care about their players. They care about how much money they can squeeze out of them before they say boo, so have fun being a part of that game of tug-of-war if you decide to buy.

Creative Assembly have failed to keep their product in working order for months on end at this point. All while developing new, paid DLC. I will not speculate on the internal problems that are evident, but this is unacceptable from a company that still views TWH3 as a top revenue stream. This review will be updated after the game is stable for 6 months, as consistency is something CA has shown to have problems with.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Corporate Ethics"
"If you love Warhammer for the lore and the battle, and/or you have a hard time getting tabletop games going, this will absolutely help you lean into your addiction while letting you get into the world from a different angle. The game may have had a rocky start on day 1, but the UI is far improved, the bugs have been largely squashed, and with the advent of Immortal Empires, Warhammer 3 is looking to become one of the best PC games (and certainly one of the best strategy games) of 2022, despite itself. 

The only gripe I can really speak to is that the often extremely heavy lore and the unchallenged brutality of the setting are sometimes tossed to the wind in favor of bowing to societal pressures from all fronts: Money, politics, fear of censorship, etc. Regardless of whatever slot one sits in on the political spectrum, adaptations can still be true to what the source material was/is and be tastefully done without being dismissive of entire aspects of whole factions and races within a work of fiction. Creative Assembly clearly, however unfortunately, said, ""Yes Daddy,"" to Games Workshop pushing for the models and story/stories to be closer in line with the more whimsical, kid-friendly approach to their fantasy world in the Age of Sigmar reboot. It serves to make for a less honest adaptation of a world that until late resembled the prejudices, inhumanity (pun not intended, but very much approved. Bc Elves. And Daemons.), and endless violence of our own world in a way that was more palatable, but still very much disquieting and thought provoking. 

Sort of the point of fantasy and fictitious storytelling of any kind, isn't it? To serve as metaphor for our own existence? Life is spooky after all, and sometimes we might need to relate to a character in a fantasy world to be able to navigate the fuckery of the one we live in. 

Or MAYBE it's 5am,  my brain has been hijacked by coke-addled squirrels, and/or I'm actually 3 red pandas in a trench coat. WHO KNOWS. I'll ask the moving-induced sleep deprivation.

TL;DR: Everything is on fire, Cheese, games, sex, and booze are the only good things left in the world, and Warhammer 3 is pretty dope, but not as dope as you, random citizen (Not you, Chet/Chad/Tad...

"Not many hours in, but I can see already that this is a completely different animal compared to TWW2.
I am very impressed by the game's performance and optimization, and by the crazy idea that is Immortal Empires.

Otherwise, I would be writing here the same review I wrote for TWW, or no review at all.

There are few games out there that offer this level of graphical quality, even less that are optimized to this degree. Probably none that offers a campaign as comprehensive and as ambitious as Immortal Empires.

If you have the hardware, the money, the 100GB of disk space, and the prohibitive amount of time (probably 100 hours for the tutorial alone), then this is a unique game that you absolutely have to try.

The game's graphical quality is something subjective. The performance and optimization though, are pretty objective and measurable. The game includes one of the most deterministic benchmarks in the industry (TWW2 wasn't bad either).

The game menu offers pretty much all the graphical settings you may want this gen, and it detects my Rx 6000 out of the box and its features, unlike TWW2. I am getting very similar (-5 to -8) FPS to TWW2 benchmark, all settings maxed.

The problem with TWW2 were the crashes, and the deal breaker were crashes in-battle. So far no crashes in TWW3 in a very short play time, but also with this level of optimization, it is hard for me to imagine. TWW2 had my power supply begging for mercy. If I get a crash, I will update my review otherwise.

I have to first of all applaud the work of Feral here, achieving numbers on par with Windows and sometimes better, depending on how bloated your installation was in the first place. Moreover, now that this game has been free-to-play, we can now see and measure by ourselves. I wonder, what the experiences of Mac users have been.","Technical Performance & Optimization, Content Scope & Ambition, Hardware & Time Investment"

"Before version 2.0: This game was good but held back by a questionable game mechanics, to the point it wasn't really worth playing it.

After version 2.0: This is the ultimate Warhammer and Total war experience, the culmination of all the fantastic work that Creative Assembly has done throughout the trilogy. The vast variety of factions, each with their own mechanics and each legendary lord within their faction adding their own spin onto it again provides an incredible amount of variety of gameplay. 

The newest factions part of Warhammer 3 are all well made and vastly different to each other - including existing factions, this game also features probably the best tutorial of the entire series which really gives a great intro to the whole over-arching storyline. Most will however enjoy the Immortal Empires campaign far more than anything else, which is still in beta but in a good palce.

Highly recommend this for any Warhammer (as this is probably the best warhammer game out there) and Total War fans.

"Review at Patch: Launch
Hours Clocked: 24.4

NOTE: This review is mostly tailored to people familiar with the series. If this is not your first Total War, and/or First Total War: Warhammer game, I would look to a different review that covers the basics of the series.

I have been looking forward to Total War: Warhammer III for a while, so when I finally get to play it I dived right in. The Prologue Campaign was pretty good. While it was mostly on rails, the story was engaging enough that despite it being a prolonged tutorial, I found it worth playing through.

If you're familiar with the series, there's not a whole lot to be said. Some changes to sieges makes do change up the routine, but overall it is what you expect to get in terms of gameplay and variety from various factions. If you've been happy with the series, you'll find some usual gripes about one thing or another. Aside from the possibility the performance of the game might be vastly different, nothing stands out that is overwhelmingly different from prior entries.

The Factions have been fun to play and the Campaign seems faster paced than it was in Total War: Warhammer II. Timing when you do certain things does have some risk/reward element and unlike the previous Campaigns, this one feels more dynamic for better or for worse. Again, if you're familiar with the series, once you dial in the needed pacing, the game will feel familiar.

The game is not without quirks and flaws. The additions to sieges leave some things to be desired. The AI really doesn't handle you making complicated split attacks well. I've found it incredibly easy to cheese attacking settlements by splitting up my forces and the AI won't react accordingly and leaves whole sections undefended, even if that's where your main host is.

Diplomacy as usual has some bizarre highs and lows. While Slaanesh has a powerful ability to just outright ""buy"" a vassal, the fact you cannot be allied when you do it is frankly an odd choice. You can kick them and quickly grab them, but it takes 10 turns for the cooldown and on top of it, you take a penalty for the carefully managed long game of converting allies, not to mention it just feels like that goes against the point. Some high points is that because of the map, it seems like if you put in the work, you can get some interesting alliances if you put the time into it.

My specs are listed below, and I had no issue playing the game. To me, the performance feels similar to the previous entries in the series. While this worked for me, a buddy that I play co-op with did not have the same experience, but I am not sure what his specs are. However, since my buddy and I normally have similar experiences, for this particular game I will note that your mileage may vary.

Overall my recommendation of Total War: Warhammer III is Recommended.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[list]
    [*]It's more of what you'd expect from Total War: Warhammer.
    [*]I appreciate some of the new additions to sieges.
    [*]The new factions are fun to play, and so far every Chaos Faction feels different enough to stand on their own.
    [*]While I personally did not have performance problems, people I play co-op with did, so your mileage may vary.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
[list]
    [*]There's a few spots where the AI makes weird choices, but hasn't ruined my experience.
    [*]A few bits of the UI could explain some things better, especially when it comes to Chaos Faction things.
    [*]The new additions to sieges are nice, but the AI does seem to struggle on the defensive.
    [*]Diplomacy feels ""off"" especially with Slaanesh. Being unable to vassalize an ally with their special means just makes it awkward.

"Very disappointing. CA are clearly incapable of fixing the issues with the game. AI is the worst it's ever been for the franchise. The AI is literally not capable of pathing on maps. I skip every single siege battle and just use auto resolve, attacking or defending, because the experience of actually doing the battles is so miserable.

Melee units can't walk in a straight line to a target reliably. Introduce anything mega advanced like having to walk around a corner and they just crap themselves, idle where they are or choose a path to the target that involves circumventing the entire map. No joke, they walk literal kilometres in the wrong direction AWAY FROM THE SELECTED TARGET if you don't herd them. By herd, I mean select the unit, select the destination. Select the destination as fast as you can 200 times to try to get them to path to it instead of away form it.

 The ranged units will often simply not shoot, when they have clear los. I had an enemy general on a flying mount right in front of 10 units of archers. The archers just stand there, do nothing. I'm favouring single entity units simply because there able to navigate from a to b better. Factions that reply on ranged are basically just 2nd rate choices now. Skaven being a good exmaple.

They've tried patching AI, when they do, it typically get's worse, not better. They clearly have no clue how to manage the AI system or make improvements to it. I suspect the level of technical debt they have allowed to build up has put them in a situation where there simply incapable of making changes or fixing issues.

In the mean while, CA are happy to squat down over our dinner plates to release some ""content"" for us at twice the previous price and with less in it.

"I've changed my rating multiple times with the company that makes these games, ""Creative Assemly."" They do some really good work, but also have some very bad PR and QA when releasing updates and DLC. A lot of stuff breaks, and then they have to get downvoted to Hell in order for them to do anything about it. Unfortunately, this will probably continue.

However, I need to talk about the game. If you love Medieval Fantasy or want to just see armies clash in glorious fashion, the Warhammer trilogy is an excellent asking price. The problem is, you will not be able to play every faction. A lot of stuff is locked behind DLC. You can however, pick a faction you'd like to try, and then just purchase THAT DLC. It pays to get good with how a faction works and plays because they all basically have different mechanics. Just look through a faction and see if it makes you go ""That looks cool"" then give the DLC (if any) a purchase. They're all not that badly priced. It's badly priced if you want EVERY faction, which I've ended up collecting over the years. The problem is is that if you're completionist, you'll want everything. I've purchased every faction and still basically play two factions regularly: The Empire, and the Vampire Counts, and those factions are free with Warhammer 1. 

Warhammer 3 is excellent in that you can play Warhammer 1 and 2's gigantic world map for literally hundreds of hours. It is a fantastic blending of everything they've worked on over the last 10 years, and the scope and scale of everything is mind-bogglingly impressive. It's almost over-whelming. That's why I say, just start with 1 or 2 factions that interest you and learn how to play them, because you will be playing that faction for most of your game time. If you're wanting all faction DLC, wait for a sale, and go ham. I think the prices are a little over-priced, but mostly fair. Your enjoyment will be tested on whether you like really long campaigns with learning how to manage an army on a field. There is a lot to learn, but it's not overwhelming to the point where you won't know how to play. The game offers great in-game tutorials as you play, as well as offering a prologue to the main storyline of Warhammer 3 that teaches you everything you need to know about how to manage your towns, grow them, and how to grow and use your armies in battle. Each army type has a strength and weakness, and it's best to learn not to send horseman galloping into a field of spear infantrymen unless you want your horses to all die. Learning how each unit works is fascinating and helps you grow stronger. 

All in all, I recommend this game. It has repeatable patterns of CA releasing updates that break parts of the game here and there, but not to the point where you can't start the game and play. It's mostly broken mechanics and other monetary bullshit, that they only seem to fix when everyone mass down-votes them. That's why you'll see a ""Mostly Positive"" with an ""Overwhelminlgy Negative"" mixed in from time to time. But, if it's the only way to get them stablize the game each patch, then that's how it has to be. This game rocks.","Technical Stability & Support, Consumer Value & Pricing Model, Gameplay & Content Accessibility"

"I guess I am falling all the other reviews. This will (hopefully) be a great game, but for now its mhhhh. 
They have tried to mix it up from the previous two installments, with a new siege style. Effectively the longer a siege lasts the more points you get which you can spend on building more defences, this should make a siege into a collapsing bag, where you slowly pull troops back to a central defence. Unfortunately the defences take so long to build, that the siege is long over by the time they do any good. 
Others have detailed the horrid camapign, in a nut shell you need three terroitories and 2/3 armies. If you expand beyond that you really cant win as portals appear everywhere spawning corruption and chaos armies.  The first time you go into the chaos lands to complete the linear missions is fun, but this gets dry very quickly, as you rinse and repeat over and over. 
Then there are the armies (again, hopefully more to be added). There is chaos undivided, which are ok, but not as much fun as chaos in WH2, all the other chaos are worse versions of this, with limited rotas, either lacking average infantry or adequate cavalry, or artillery, the effort to give them a flavour just makes them feel hamstrung. 
Kislev are ok, playing like the empire, but Cathay are the only list to feel like they have any real new character. 
I am 88 hours in, have completed the campaigns with three factions, and done a world domination - the latter felt like a full time job, ...so dry...every battle feels the same, every region seems identical.... auto resolve after auto resolve...

"[h3] Update April 2024 [/h3]

I decided to change my recommendation to positive in view of recent news regarding layoffs at CA, the rampant rumors around Total War: Warhammer III being scaled down from what was originally planned, and lastly because the additions to Shadows of Change were pretty good. 

Despite the fact that multiplayer campaigns barely function, despite the random CTD's, units having seriously bad pathfinding around gates and ladders, Warriors of Chaos and Cathay tech not working properly, or that there are heroes with not enough skills to put their skill points into, I still love this game. A lot of that love lies in thanks to the modding community, but the love and work that [strike]CA[/strike] the Warhammer team have put into it is undeniable.

Finally, a message to SEGA. [b]Do not let this game die before it gets a chance to redeem itself[/b] The whole reason we're here is due to CA leadership being incompetent, out of touch, greedy [spoiler]dirt[/spoiler]bags
Punish them, not the game that makes money despite their best efforts to gun it down while it's laying the golden eggs.

[hr][/hr]
[h3] Update Feb 2024[/h3]

Since I posted this review, CA made a public statement ""apologizing"" (quotes because the wording of the apology was very corporate and didn't really make the point of owning up to mistakes) but also promising to be better. [b] In this vein, they cut the price of Total War: Pharaoh, refunded all owners, and promised to add content to Shadows of Change to match the asking price. [/b] This all happened in late December. 

They are currently coming out with a series of blog posts detailing the added units/lords/heroes in every race (at the time of writing this, only Cathay and Tzeentch are out) and the update is due next week. 

However, I will not be changing my recommendation yet, as this whole ordeal has been going on since the game was released. I'd like to have them be consistently good for a good long while before I can honestly recommend the game. Plus, it's still riddled with bugs.

[h3] Original Review in November [/h3]

I'm sorry, as many hours of entertainment this game, which I truly love, has given me, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. 

Unfortunately, Creative Assembly have been treating it as a money maker that will always make money no matter what, essentially abandoning it in the process. 

Their idea of ""support"" is to let a haggard, poor dlc team of, I would wager, less than twenty people to maintain, patch, AND produce content, while at the same time  increasing prices to absurd amounts for lesser quality content than for every other dlc ever. 

In the meantime, as the team is stretched super thin, glaring problems (which the community has addressed in mere days via mods) have been left in the game for months at a time. Imagine buying a faction dlc focused on a specific unit, and that faction being completely unable to recruit said unit FOR THREE ENTIRE MONTHS.

And to top things off, they came out with a statement as a response to community backlash for the latest price increase, basically saying ""we want more money, buy the dlc or we drop support entirely"" 

Tldr: CA have abandoned this game. QA is non-existent, major bugs are in the game for months on end, and CA came out with an ultimatum to buy the dlc at an absurd price or they'll drop support.","Developer Support & Content Updates, Technical Performance & Bugs, Modding Community Value"
"The below comments are still accurate. Single model of broken unit causes cavalry units to cease moving (mass is always so tricky when it would benefit the player: PC has no issue with chariots that never lose speed).  UNITS STILL CANNOT PATH AROUND GATES AND CORNERS CORRECTLY.

buggy and crashy (standard for unfinished games)
unit collision that would make Shogun TW (2000) blush
enemy units are most disruptive after being routed, turning into drag nets as they are unable to leave the melee and seem to path in a random direction through your units, destroying any formation or cohesion and at times dragging models out of combat

"The gameplay is pretty fun and enjoyable, but the constant crashing is maddening. Of the time I have spent playing, I think I have replayed the same battles on average 2-3 times because each time they finish and I am back to the campaign map I am presented with a crash before I can save the game. The last straw for me was playing one of the 40+ minute boss battles and scraping through just barely only to have the game crash when I completed it. 

If you enjoy groundhog day this might be worth a consideration, otherwise I would recommend waiting a few months for the game breaking crashing to be fixed.

"I’ve been playing Total War since the original Medieval Total War came out in 2002. That’s now over two decades of supporting this franchise, and Creative Assembly. That stops now.

CA has made some pretty bad missteps and mistakes in the past, with dodgy launches, buggy games, removing features, and flat out shovelware being spat out (looking at you, Thrones of Britannia). Despite this, the company also put out some amazing games during that time, and many people working there have shown they care about the games they make, and the community that supports them.

However, the current state of WH3, and the behaviour of certain executives at CA, has devolved to a state that is so appalling, it’s scarcely believable. WH3 has been a buggy, half finished mess since launch. The Realm of Chaos campaign is the flat out worst Total War campaign I’ve ever seen. Patches have been slow, barely fix any issues, and more often than not introduce a new suite of bugs to go alongside the old ones. Couple this with poor AI, factions with limited flavour or choice, and mechanics that are totally broken means the game cannot be recommended in the state it’s in.

Whilst this is disappointing, as WH2 became a truly brilliant experience after a while, and WH3 has the foundation to be another excellent game, the real kick in the teeth is the condescending and frankly insulting attitude CA are showing to their players. CA has basically hiked the price of DLC by 150%, whilst reducing the content included in the DLC, and failing to support the game appropriately. A certain executive then had the nerve to effectively threaten the playerbase with ending support for the game if they don’t buy it. 

But that’s the problem isn’t it CA, you aren’t supporting the game. You’re egregiously squeezing a loyal and dedicated community to prop up the development of a hero shooter, a genre that would’ve been new and exciting in 2014, whilst simultaneously sneering at the community that has kept you in business for 20 years. 

As a result, I’m out. Don’t buy this game. Don’t buy any DLC. Don’t support CA in any way anymore. If CA realise the error of their ways and actually change course, I’ll update this review. However, based on the complete contempt they seem to view their community with, it’s probably more likely that pigs will fly. Ironically, flying pigs would be a more developed and thought out unit than most of the ones they include in their DLC.","Historical Loyalty, Technical Stability, Corporate Behavior"

"I've played Warhammer 1, 2 and 3. First time leaving a review. I've played lots of Warhammer 2, fair bit of 3 as well. Scope and concepts? Amazing. Super cool ideas. And I enjoyed 2 a lot after potion of speed update, which made turn times playable, among other things. But they left the game broken in it's final patch (ambush AI completely broken), and were okay leaving it like that. It just left a sour taste in the mouth after so much fun with a great game.

Then Warhammer 3 launches, game broken and unfinished. Some fixes, more breaks, some fixes, more breaks. Siege pathfinding just absolutely broken, tower minigames, AI AFKing on world map, they don't launch sieges and just stand around forever waiting to attack. Cathay was marketed on ""defending the bastion"", but armies never launch the attack, and if they do, they can still be auto resolved on very hard (aka, auto resolve still has serious issues, eg dwarves vs norsca and slaneesh auto resolve diff). Just... Warhammer 2, from potion of speed update up to before the final patch which broke it, was great. Not perfect, but fun, lots of new content, game worked, issues were fixed within reasonable time frames? Warhammer 3? Core issues like AI just afking on map and sieges being just...... pathfinding and LOS drives me nuts, barriers popping up out of nowhere to make it worse. Cant even compensate by destroying walls properly, as it always leaves invulnerable sections. There's so much potential in the game, it's so frustrating to see it squandered over just, the game being broken and not working as intended. Let alone the insane powercreep (cough skulltaker, cough) which is just ridiculous levels of broken that all you can do is laugh really.

I'd just like to see the game series that I've spent so much time in actually be fixed and playable, not a buggy mess, and this is the only way I can really express that. I haven't played in months because among other things in life being busy, the bugs, pathfinding/LOS issues and sieges general design just drives me up the wall after a while, along with no challenge cause the AI just AFKs and watches me play solitaire. Hopefully you can turn the game around CA, rather than giving it the Three Kingdoms treatment, or leaving it broken like Warhammer 2.

"Lets not talk about how bad is pricing sometimes here
TWW3 is a great game itself with a giant potential for further improvements. That's one of the biggest Warhammer based video game, medieval fantasy based video game I would say which does have both interesting & pretty big global map as well as battles done in interesting manner. 
It's never a talk that this game is 10/10 and has everything being done ideal. It tries, and it actually **tries well**. I've spent so far near 300 hours playing it, and I enjoy playing it evenings after a job, I enjoy playing it together with friends of my. 
It's just a **great potential product** which you can already taste much. Though, aiming my positive review still for further improvements.

"Played it in ver 6.2 

This is has an extensive Workshop support but some MOD only work in certain versions of the game.
Beware that you also need to be careful in the MOD load order and enable them on the game launcher.

I only play it on 2 campains:

-The Lost God (an amazing prologe, if you remember to close the 'tuturial message' before doing what you are being told to do)

-The Realm of Chaos (Amazing lore but the passing is a bit too slow if you are trying to save Ursun. 
I won the campain via comple map dominance before the 2nd portal to the 'realms of chaos' pop up)

To be honest, the tutorial campain for me was better than the actual game campain.
It felt far more immersive Yuri Journey than 'who ever faction you want to play' but with the same story.

Mods realy help me to complete the campain and make Boris a Barbarian from Skyrim with an army of Snow Dragons and Cryo Phoenix (Similar to Anivia from Freljord)
Also used a mod to even the odds when fighting in weird climates, diseases and lack of qualified personel to defend a barren wasteland.

The DLC is only if you want a 2nd playthrough, to be honest it isn't mandatory.
Try the 'Realms of Chaos' campain before going into 'Inmortal Empires', the last campain is just a bigger map and to be honest feels more empty than 'Realms of Chaos'

Maybe if they had made their campains a bit more like the tutorial or like those from Warcraft 3.
They could have just made fewer races and just focus on those.

I know by doing that, they wouldn't be able to monetize new factions as easy as they do with their new DLCs
Warhammer 'Old World' Lore is rich and it is a shame they weren't able to make a more interesting 'main story'.

Like it or hate it, 
This game is a good staring point for those who want to know what is Warhammer and not just 40k.

The game does introduce a lot of great new QoL changes and systems, but conversely the only campaign right now is at times very frustrating, in a way that even the Eye of the Vortex just wasn't. The lack of races, mods and units also hinders the replay value.

"Overall another amazing Warhammer title. Can look toward my Warhammer 2 review for more detail, as this is obviously a sequel to such. Greatly enjoy the vastly improved visuals, map, and reworked or newer factions added along with the detailed game modes and newer systems implemented regarding them. BUT there are SOME DRAWBACKS as well. Main drawbacks being the limited playable factions until mortal empires is released, bugs and overall balancing issues, and larger optimization and performance issues than previous titles needing attention / editing  for proper gameplay for most players. Overall, i'd say this is another fantastic release, BUT, i'd RECOMMEND WAITING UNTIL A PRICEDROP / OPTIMIZATION PATCH / MORTAL EMPIRE RELEASE. The overall lack of playable factions as well as the extremely rough optimization currently and balancing issues definitely need to be addressed. Once mortal empires drops, the playable faction list will be much larger, so i'd withhold until then. A solid 7 or 8 /10 until optimization or mortal empires, which would likely boost it up to an absolute 10/10 masterpiece. All players being able to perform their turn at once is also a GODSENT feature in regards to time consumption playing multiplayer.

The year is 2016. Warhammer Fantasy has been blown up and replaced by Age of Sigmar to mixed reviews. The Warhammer you know and love is well and truly gone. You hear that there's a new Total War game coming out based on the franchise. 

Oh boy, another game getting the warhammer license. Time to flip the coin and see if it will be good or bad. 

Turns out its pretty ground breaking. Turns out they plan to make this a trilogy. 

Turns out, they plan to combine all 3 into one mega game. 

yea, okay. 

The year is 2022. Immortal Empires is out. One of the most ambitious gaming projects in not just strategy games, but games as a medium in the last 20 years, has just entered its final stage. 

Games Workshop currently sees unprecedented growth as a company, and warhammer is back on the big stage. 

Does the game have bugs? can it be a bit janky at times? Of course, its a MASSIVE game.

its a fun as shit to play? 

you bet your little ass.

"I can't really recommend this game at the current state.There are too many bugs despite they had 1 year to fix them.I'm guilty of buying some of their DLC's thinking that they will support the game for longer,but that's not the case.
If you want to get spend a decent amout of time on a strategy game buy Stellaris instead.

"Not the best TW game out there, but definitely the best recent TW title.","Historical Comparison, Franchise Standing, Recency Evaluation"
"While I have gotten alot of time out of twwh3 and spent an unhealthy amount of money following the trilogy and its insane amount of DLC through to the modern day. I cannot in good conscious recommend the game in its current state. 

This is due not to balance, not to the core gameplay, not to the visuals, but to the sheer volume of technical debt this game is in, a degree in which even Stellaris has a run for its money in just how deeply broken it is. 

Its been years and yet the game still runs horribly, loading times are slow even with a multi-gigabyte per second SSD and on an old disc drive you might as well go out to lunch every time you enter or exit a battle. Slowing the game to a crawl.

Once you are ingame, your fps will crater if your gpu isnt on the high end of midline unless you dumpster your settings, the game paradoxically running better on higher unit sizes, atleast on my gpu, and other such estranged issues and inexplicable lag that will haunt you even when the game is working properly.

Which it wont be. The fire at will bug still occurs semi frequently, a bug that requires you to manually target every single ranged unit in your army, in the campaign the A.I cheats frequently and bugs out immensely even more often. From A.I building completely inexplicable armies of 6 different types of infantry, casting spells on completely empty open terrain, standing around hopelessly in battles it started, or just breaking entirely. As can be seen with the lizardmen and tomb kings major factions which currently just idle in their capitols until destroyed. 

If you want to run a DLC business model, I'll buy it as the least scummy option to run a game indefinitely. But ultimately, the game needs to FUNCTION PROPERLY for that dlc to be worth buying. 

If the game is unplayable, or just downright unfun, then you will never get your moneys worth, even if you dont mind the DLC. And that is the state of the game right now. All the completely unnecessary friction makes me stop and question if I even want to play the game between each and every turn. And increasingly the answer is no.","Technical Stability, Performance & Optimization, Long-term Support & Technical Debt"

"Great concept, seeing Warhammer units and locals in action had me very excited.  
But even from release things have been consistently half-arsed and bareboned. Then DLC later kept increasing in cost while SIMULTANEOUSLY decreasing in value.  The latest DLC has less units, with low effort detail (Tzaangors just have blue horns) and less animations (the War Drum has none).   
This could maybe be forgiven if there was attention elsewhere, but the base game has had known bugs for months (Nakai still cant recruit Kroxigors), and promised reworks that was supposed to come out the same time as the DLC (like sieges) have had no mention.

"It's the best large-scale strategy I've ever played (only if you're playing solo), multiplayer has a big issues like desync. If you play with friends in multiplayer campaign you'll encountered with issues like: 
1. In some turn game just freezing and after few seconds you are thrown out of it, without any notification (this happens even not in the battle, just in global map).
2. No matter where you are in middle of the battle or in global map sometimes you can see desync with your friends by the following notification ""Waiting for a player ..."" and you think ""oh it takes few seconds and after that game will resume"". I said you that we have 3 ways what will happen: 
1) game MAYBE will resume; 
2) game can freeze with the same notification ""Waiting for a player ..."" in everyone and you can do nothing, the only way to solve it is press ALT+F4; 
3) last but not least, one of your friends will throw out from the game without any notification, but you can think that your friend reconnect to the session, I say you NO. You need to quit to main menu and rehost the campaign.

I don't know when these issues started, but as I see on the forums, players have been complaining about this for at least 9 months.

Conclusion:
Game is the best if you are fan large-scale strategies, but only for solo game, multiplayer is broken, it's impossible to play. I ""HOPE"" developers will fix this.

"It's an excellent game. People sometimes review it poorly because they don't agree with CA's actions. If you look at it on its own merits though, the gameplay, unit variety, and scope is immense and the amount of content is truly unparalleled. I've had a lot of fun with it, and this is coming from a fan who prefers historical games. Yes there are bugs and lingering issues in the engine like the gate bug, and annoying features like butt ladders, and the company making the game have made questionable decisions, including the abstraction of detail many players like myself miss from previous years. Overall though, Warhammer 3 has received many quality of life improvements that make going back to the older games a bit painful - stat breakdowns, replenishment, unique faction playstyles and campaign mechanics.

"I’ve loved the Total War series for years and spent hundreds of hours in Warhammer 1 & 2  but Warhammer 3 is an absolute mess in its current state. After years on the market, the game is still plagued with bugs, and every major update seems to break something else. Since patch 6.3, the AI barely recruits armies at all, making entire campaigns feel pointless and empty.

Instead of focusing on fixing the core game, Creative Assembly keeps pushing overpriced DLC with questionable value. Many DLCs release in a broken state and need fixes later.

On top of that, if you want to experience the game fully, you’re basically forced to own Warhammer 1 and 2 and their DLCs on top of paying full price for Warhammer 3 itself. That’s a ridiculous amount of money for a single game experience.

To make matters worse, I currently own 7 out of 28 DLCs available for this game, and Steam tells me the rest would cost me €319.22. Let me repeat: this is supposed to be a full-price title, yet playing it in its entirety costs far more than any AAA release on the market.

"(Two Year Update): Don't EVER buy this game. It is an awful, unplayable piece of garbage that puts the previous two games to shame. Just by TWW1 or 2 and enjoy playing a good game. These loser devs have done to this game in 2 YEARS is charge 50% of the total title price for a single half-size DLC, add in hot garbage systems that are unnecessary and not fun to play such as Fortnite Lite for your new Siege battles. Enjoy building 500 random buildings a siege and being completely unable to direct your troops, or alternatively, spend 30 minutes smacking an obstruction. The fun never ends in TWW3 though because you can also get off one night after a full Saturday of play, get on Sunday morning, and your save is unplayable due to a new trash feature CA has added for only a mandatory $500.

(Original Review): Don't even consider buying this trash heap and buy game 2 instead (I have 1000+ hours in it). It runs better, it plays better, it is better.

"""Hi everyone. I’m **Rob Bartholomew**, Chief Product Officer here at Creative Assembly.

To get right into it: our costs are up. Unfortunately, that means that prices have to rise. We know any increase is going to be tough, which is why our prices have remained fairly stable over the past few years. The downside is that any increase today is going to be more noticeable.

There’s no good time to increase prices, and we have not taken this step lightly. However, this is the business reality of supporting WARHAMMER III and ensuring we’re able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned.

That said, we do need to challenge ourselves to ensure that this cost still offers good value. Ultimately, that’s up to each of you to decide and we’ll keep trying to balance that.

"Pretty good bang for your buck, though there are a few large problems that don't look like they're going to be patched any time soon. 

-Diplomacy and general AI is fairly bad, even on harder difficulties. A lot of this is due to weighted values not being arranged correctly, a lot of it is down to the core behaviors being nonsensical. 
-Warhammer 1 factions still don't feel great to play. They've gotten a fair few overhauls but they could probably use a building rework, more units, better campaign mechanics, etc. Their economies also feel generally weaker than factions that came later. I would honestly say that WH2 factions have the opposite problem, where they have a slightly stronger economy (and I would argue stronger factions/units overall). If faction balance bothers you at all then this is something to consider.
-Steamrolling is still an issue and the systems implemented to slow it are uninteresting or unfun. 
-The process of actually transitioning to the late game can feel quite slow and you'll often feel like your campaign is basically done by the time you start getting armies of high-tier units. The process of retrofitting armies with these units is also pretty annoying.

"Amended review (was positive, now negative until fixed).

I love Warhammer and I’ve poured an embarrassing number of hours into WH3 (3 different accounts between the mrs and me), but at ~9 years into this trilogy and after more DLCs/patches than I can count, the game has no business being this buggy and unfinished. 

The current cycle pushed me over the edge. Campaign AI is all over the place, especially after 6.3, (major factions sitting idle, weird passivity, protectionist blob behavior), battles still cough up pathing and targeting nonsense (particularly sieges), and every patch feels like two steps forward, one faceplant back. I shouldn’t have to mod basic sanity back into a flagship strategy title this far in. 

Even the Kislev re-work (which while is great from a 'we're willing to listen to the community' angle,  is sorely lacking the in # of units for the faction - seriously - do a comparison between Kislev and other factions (IMHO units like the things and the woods and Incarnate Elemental only make sense for Ostankya) What Kislev needs is 1 more (melee) hero, 3-5 more units incl/ an additional artillery option (Ice Guard Bear Riders and/or Ice Guard Sleds anyone?) and 3-4 more RoRs. Considering the amazing work of the modding community - half of your work is already done for you CA... Just saying.

But what really stings is the business/meta layer. The DLC bloat/treadmill means “complete” costs a fortune, yet QA/regression keeps slipping. And the community side feels… corporate. Partner programs, managed access, and PR tone-policing have gotten so heavy that creators who call out company behavior (not just unit balance) get sidelined. You can see the ripple effect in the LegendofTotalWar drama and others: instead of channeling community pressure into faster, cleaner fixes, we spiral into tribalism while the game remains broken for months.

I’m not asking for miracles. I’m asking for:

-Stability-first patches (lock the AI before selling anything new).
-Transparent QA (what broke, why, when it’ll be fixed).
-Reasonable DLC cadence/pricing aligned with actual quality delivered.
-Less managed messaging, more accountability with creators and players.

Flip those switches and I’ll happily flip this back to positive. Until then, it’s hard to recommend a game I adore that keeps tripping over the same rakes.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Experience, Development Progress"
"I was thrown out before the battle with the main demon three times, and a few times during big battles (which can happen at different times).

It looks like a DLC, not a new game, but it has a list of updates, a new map, and a price like a DLC, so it is okay. I see a lot of static elements, and I don’t like it—the game's progress is halted, making it boring for me. There are many UX problems. I hate using the map and managing the army sometimes. Also, I miss good information about the army; it causes chaos.

However, it is a unique game, and sometimes I want to play something like this. We have the ability to wage war with a big army, and I am happy to have this opportunity.

But in the Warhammer series, we don’t have 3D models of the army—the biggest problem for me when playing a big strategy game.","Technical Stability, Content Value, User Experience"

"Right now it's ""pretty good."" So far I haven't run into any major performance issues like some other people. I'm at least getting 60fps in battles and 70-80 on the map, with all settings maxed. I could no doubt improve it by dropping some things down, but it's good enough for me. (high end PC, 3080, 5800X). Like most people, I'm not a huge fan of the all-red UI, but the game play is pretty much exactly what I was looking forward to. Like TWW2, I will probably dabble in this until the Mortal Empires campaign arrives, and then play the **** out of it. It was still worth pre-ordering just for the ogres. The specifically aligned chaos gods are a bit lacking compared to undivided, humans, and ogres.

I will add that I also had a mouse alignment problem when it started in 1080p and I upped it to 1440p, but it went away after quitting to desktop and restarting, and never came back.

Like TWW 1 and 2, I am sure this will receive loads of balance, improvements, and DLCs as time goes by. If your a fan of the series it might be worth picking up now, but it will definitely be worth it once the sandbox campaign comes out.

"EDIT 3: It's fucked again... 

EDIT 2: We good now 

The game is great, don't get me wrong. But $25 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR A DLC? 

EDIT: I wanted to expand a bit more regarding the pricing. I love the game, I really do. I wish I could have more time to play it religiously. Unfortunately, DLC price policy is fucking ridiculous. Rubbing salt to the wound, each and every time they are adding less and less and less content with each stupidly priced package. And it seems they don't notice the amount of bugs that are in the game. Have you seen the Kroxigors? Can you recruit them with Nakai without a mod? Nope.

When Forge of the Chaos Dwarves was released, I though to myself: ""Neat, I love the faction. I'll buy it. It doesn't make sense the high price for the content, but I want to see for myself how this is."" And of course, I bought it. Some of you might say that was a stupid move. Yes, absolutely it was. But I'm enjoying the Chaos Dwarves as much as I can.

Then Shadows of Change got announced and it mentioned some additional stuff for Cathay with I really like the faction as well. They could use a buff here and there but still, I like it. 

However, everything came crashing down like the fucking Hindenburg in 1937 when the content was announced, and it fucked everything up after they announced AGAIN that for $25  you will get:

1) 3 FUCKING LEGENDARY LORDS
2) 12 FUCKING UNITS
3) 9 NEW REGIMENTS OF RENOWN

THAT SMALL LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT CONTENT FOR $25... 

But it gets worse, not only they think we are fucking stupid enough to believe the horseshit they released as a statement. Specially this part: 

""To get right into it: our costs are up. Unfortunately, that means that prices have to rise. We know any increase is going to be tough, which is why our prices have remained fairly stable over the past few years. The downside is that any increase today is going to be more noticeable.""

And sure, how do you want to keep being stable and have money if you keep doing stupid stuff? Thrones of Britannia... Binned since people didn't like it. Pharaoh, I can positively assure you it will be binned as well since it's trying to be sold as a Bronze Age game, which is not completely true. I guarantee, if Pharaoh doesn't meet the standards they set, it will end up as Britannia. Which is sad. Thrones of Britannia setting and sieges are top notch, it's a shame the rest of the game doesn't come up to that level.

Sorry for the long text and honestly I don't care anymore about this. I will continue playing it, but I will wait maybe until 2029 when the upcoming DLCs are on a very low price for me to buy them. 

How about you please listen to the community, be open for feedback and not act like a bunch of spoiled brats that get offended if somebody doesn't praise their gold-covered piece of crap served on the plate. 

Be better, be creative. Give us Medieval 3, Empire 2, Shogun 3. Hell, get the viking era correctly and I assure you, people will start having hope for you again. And please for the love of god, can we get naval combat again? That thing is awesome and new games are lacking naval combat even if the setting actually has famous naval battles.

 At the moment, you guys are not being managed correctly and that has to change. Game Development is hard, I know that for a fact since I already participated in a couple of very small projects, but raking the price from $15 to $25 for less content?

Old review:
CA is doing a great job earning back player's confidence","Technical Stability, Developer Reputation"
"Here is the deal,

I have played every single TW and dealt with some letdowns from CA such as the rome 2 launch, Attila’s optimization issues, the abandonment of three Kingdoms.

I have seen some great stuff from CA as well like shogun 2, Imperator Augustus update and Warhammer 2.

I want this game to be better than all the above but some serious changes need to happen.

I have never disliked a game so much that I would put as much effort into a review like I have today. I normally post one word reviews and carry on because I have better things to do with my time. This has been the worst experience I’ve had with a developer ever.

Warhammer 3 has some serious campaign, pricing and lack of fun issues.

The single player campaign is a mess. I’ve completed two campaigns so far, kislev and daniels. I have never been so frustrated by the AI to consider mods but I’m going to install some for my third. For example 15 turns into a normal game and skovald attacks me from 30 miles away with a gold chevroned doom stack of great sword blood letters. Even if my forces could oppose him he would run around my army sacking and razing undefended settlements just like in Warhammer 1. In addition AI cheating is so brutal it takes the fun out of the game. Aggression and war declaration has been taken up to 11 to the point where you can’t afford a big enough army to defend against all the swarming factions or progress in a meaningful way. I understand that CA is updating anti player bias in 4.0 but the fact that this is being addressed two years later is just plain unacceptable. Before the CA simps or employees say “just lower the difficulty” all I have to say is that that this is not in line with Warhammer 1 & 2. I know what the difficulty level is in the total war genre and this is not normal. 

The best TW comparison I can come up with is it’s like realm divide gets happens on turn 5-6 in most campaigns.

Another gripe was partially mentioned above if I do have the upper hand the AI runs away from every engagement. My forces cannot keep up and the sacking and razing continues.

If you actually convince another ai faction to ally with you then congrats! They will drag you into more wars and then proceed to not lend assistance or build any army of their own. Again this is the anti player bias at work.

How did this happen? Warhammer 2 was the template you needed to stick with! You had a grand slam that just needed to be copy pasta’d and you ****** it up.

 I’m not going to explain what is going on with pricing because other reviews have covered it off. What I will say is Rob Barltholomew should be fired. Not because of the price increase but because of the way he treated CA’s customers. I found his response to the dlc complaints completely out of touch and condescending. I took the time to look up the parent companies ( sega-sami holdings ) operating expenses from 2022 and 2023 as it’s publicly traded. Sega's operating expenses were up like 20% year over year. 

So don’t **** on my back and tell me it’s a shower Rob! explain to me how this adds up? 

The others who complained over this pricing are correct it’s just strait up greed. I imagine I’m like most other folks that would happily pay 20% even 25% more because I generally like CA’s work but 150% justified by a lie is just infuriating. 


Here’s what’s I think players can do to improve Warhammer 3.

Pray superman sees this review so he can shame creative assembly into fixing this mess. He tried to fix the witcher he will try and fix this.

don’t buy the dlc and don’t pre order anything from any video game developer ever again 

Voice your concerns and call out CA on forums, Reddit, YouTube or pornhub

Reach out to stock analysts who cover Sega Sami holdings. Ask them if they know that a subsidiary of sega is having a bud light moment?

Ask YouTubers to not shill for these clowns. Let them know that their careers are dead if CA stops making these games. If they continue on this path the series will be wrecked before this game is through its cycle.

Don’t accept being gaslighted by people calling this “review bombing” If a customer is upset over a product it’s for a good reason. 

Ask for a developer response on the CA forums from someone who has two brain cells to rub together ( not that rodeo clown Rob ).

If CA does the right thing and fixes this mess of a game thank them and ask them not to screw another one up.
Reach out to the games workshop tell them you feel ripped off and that CA won’t help.

File BBB complaints against sega / CA.

Ask for a better customer experience. Amazon and Costco ask hardly any questions and will work with you to get refunded if something is not right. Amazon even charge backs the vendor. All the greats would never treat customers like this. If sega wants to be a big dog they need to start acting like one.


Good luck to all voicing their opinions and trying to improve this game! I hope someone from creative assembly or sega or whatever gets it together and makes this better than Warhammer 2.

"Perhaps the best installment of the Total War Franchise. Having played every installment of Total War, I can safely say that Warhammer III is one of the most gorgeous games they have made. The map has been lovingly designed to honor the source material. You won't get bored looking at the domains of each Chaos Realm. The battles are visually stimulating and enjoyable despite the continued decline in battle quality. This Total War continues the disappointing trend of moving away from the importance of tactics and formations and emphasizes the stats of blobs smashing into each other. Gone are the days of holding key choke points with tight formations of spear-walls or soaking up missile damage with defensive shield-walls. Battles are now a numbers games that are full of cheese. 

The victory mechanic is less annoying than Warhammer II's Vortex campaign. You no longer have to race to gather specific resources to reach a phase in your victory. You now win by going on expeditions into the Chaos Wastes through time-sensitive portals. The portals only open up every so often, so it can become rather annoying to be constantly waiting for a portal to open so that you can complete the campaign.

All in all, the game is well made and fun to play. A must-buy for Total War and Warhammer fans alike.","Visual & Artistic Quality, Gameplay Mechanics, Franchise Evolution"

"I'm going to be honest with you guys.
Total War: Warhammer is a great game! But it does have its downsides.
Not playwise, but because of the Dlcs. The base game on its own gives the player many races to play, and these races are pretty cool on their own. But having to buy some Dlcs just to be able to get maybe 1-2 more heroes into a race and 2-4 more units isn't really that fun. I've probably spent about 100€ or more just for the Dlcs I have, and I don't even have them all. 
Don't get me wrong, some dlcs are just amazing and worth the Money. Others are not.
I still think it's a great game. Being able to have massive Battles with Fantasy races where you can control your own troops makes a lot of time pass quickly and with joy.    

In conclusion: If you like strategic games in a fantasy setting, and you are willing to pay a couple bucks more than your usual game (not recommended if you are completely new, just use the free races). It might be the perfect long term game for you.

"This is the most amazing strategy war game ever developed.

It is very costly, but the gameplay and replay value of this game is astronomically good. 

Most games will release with enough content to keep you busy for 40 hours; 60 hours at best.

You can easily put 1000 hours into Total War. 

The AI is very good in this game, however, I can say that even on the easy setting it can be pretty unforgiving.

I find myself surrounded by three enemies upon my first 8 turns into the game and I always seem to be outnumbered with no allies in reach. 

This game is VERY CHALLENGING. I would not recommend it for casual players. I have not won a single grand campaign in all of the 20 years of this Total War series, but I still enjoy trying lol.


I would recommend this game 11/10 to strategy war fans, but only to those really seeking a challenge.

They made the game a lot better for old races like lizardmen and vampires. It's better than it was at launch. I support the IP. The game is a good mix of action with RTS battles. They reworked lords and heroes by reworking talents and traits so there is a lot more interesting utility now instead of just making doomstacks of broken combat characters.,"Gameplay Balance, Content Evolution, Mechanical Depth"

"With games, I often have ""phases"" of playing them which last for a week up to a month at a time. Sometimes, a game's longevity will only consist of one or two phases, while others last a few more. Total War: Warhammer is one of the latter. Perhaps even beyond that, as I have been playing this game consistently for well over 2 months now. For me, that says something.

I figured I'd have to leave a review when Creative Assembly made Immortal Empires available to everyone who owns the third game. Since I already had Immortal Empires, this decision had no bearing on me in terms of actual gameplay. However, this does tell me that the developers really do care about the community. Immortal Empires is an excellent experience and I believe, the definitive way to experience these games. Seeing all of the races & factions from every game come together on one map makes the experience feel complete. Each race is completely different in terms of style, roster and gameplay, allowing for countless hours to be spent on each one. They're all incredibly fun and there's a faction out there for everyone. Do you want to pummel the enemy with artillery and make them come to you? Try the Dwarfs. Do you want to swarm the enemy with mass numbers? Try Skaven. Or maybe, you'd like a more balanced roster allowing for a flexible playstyle- Empire.

Something that I don't often see mentioned, and one of my favourite aspects of the game, is the amount of detail around the Warhammer lore put into this game. Descriptions of units, items and buildings are all interesting and varied. Having not read any of the books or played the tabletop game, I find this all very engaging, helping me to keep immersed in the experience. The unit card art, soundtrack, and dozens upon dozens of maps all help to further accentuate this feeling.

All in all, Total War: Warhammer 3 is an excellent game. The main downside to me is the amount of money that needs to go into these games if you wish to unlock more races. Aside from that, blink and the hours trickle away...","Game Longevity, Developer Support, Gameplay Experience"

"Absolute masterpiece. I clocked over 1k hours in Warhammer 2, and now almost 2k in Warhammer 3. We love the Vortex campaign, it's really nice having the extra option of gameplay. The third one is truly a vast improvement, which I didn't think possible, because I religiously played the second one too. This game is truly endless, of course I have my favourite races to play, but it's always a completely different experience depending on who you play. It took me until approximately 2.5k hours of gameplay to finally master my first ratmen faction, and if I want a more chill and leisurely play, I can switch it up and play High Elves. My favourites are Greenskins of course, each of their factions are so unique because of the dynamics of the faction Lords and their affects. I have a spot dedicated in my heart for Grimgor obviously, but recently been practising some of the more difficult factions because I need a bit of a challenge (avoiding going to a higher difficulty until I run out of other options lmao). I honestly never shut up about this game, it's my favourite game hands down, of all time.","Gameplay Depth, Content Variety, Player Engagement"

"Incredibly fun but buggy game suffering from incompetent management (not to mention arrogant and complacent).

If you don't leave this game in a great state at the end of its lifecycle, forget about players buying whatever bug-infested low-effort trash you come peddling next.

The company has a history of bugged releases and abruptly abandoning projects. Most recently, they think it's okay to leave the game majorly bugged for months (breaking AI for entire factions and continents).

Ranged units often don't fire at targets, cavalry and monsters are unable to effectively kill routing units, gate bugs out and becomes indestructible in offensive siege battles, certain factions on campaign map are idle and unable to recruit units, battle audio sometimes bugs out and stops playing, and many many such issues that have not been fixed for LITERAL YEARS and likely never will be! UNACCEPTABLE!

Also, it's been almost a full year since ANY major content update. Ironically TWW2's lifecycle and dlc model was great, with frequent and high quality releases. With TWW3 they made each dlc 1.5x bigger but it take 2-3x the time for them to release it. They changed what wasn't broken likely all to sneakily justify higher prices. It would be much better to go back to TWW2's model of 2 lord packs vs 3 lords in current game if it results in more frequent updates and releases, or even a single lord pack as long as the quality is there and updates are more frequent! It should also be much easier for them to QA smaller but more frequent updates.","Technical Stability, Company Trust & Management, Gameplay Functionality"

"So far I only played with Cathay and some Slaneesh. While there are a few things about the game that annoy the hell out of me(like Confederation and Vassals), there are huge improvements to gameplay in other areas like minor settlement battles, QoL changes etc. 

Game is just fine except for the performance issues and some bugs/glitches/oversights(such as supply lines bug). It'll eventually get better and most of the gamebreaking problems will be adressed. Keep in mind that Warhammer II wasnt that good a game either on release. It only got better after years of patching and fleshing out with DLCs. Surely they're planning to do the same here. 

However, if the performance loss is due to some sort of DRM like Denuvo then CA needs to realize that what they're doing doesnt hurt the people who pirate the game. It hurts the people who legitimately paid for it. My specs are about the reccomended level, I used to play TWWH2 with 60-70 fps on mid-high graphics and ultra unit scale but here its more like 40-50 with dips to 20-30s.  Only times I've experienced that in TWWH2 were like 4 armies of skelly boys blobbing up sort of situations. Until preformance issues are adressed this review stays a big fat no.


EDIT AFTER A YEAR: While some performance issues are still there, and game could look SO MUCH better just by giving the TAA some love and preventing motion blur, at least it feels stable around 60 fps with high graphics.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Mechanics, Long-term Development"

"Oh you spent $50+ dollars on this game? That's cool. Be prepared to shell out over another $100+ for the rest of the content, and that's just lazy low estimate. If you think ""hey, these games look pretty good because they're always updating it and adding content"" you'd be somewhat right. The content/dlc's they add are either the most MINIMAL free DLC ever, or, they release what I call ""cookie crumb"" dlcs because they'll throw some new lords and units at you to play with but, they're the most lazily made additions to the games ever. If they can rip the model animations, actions and etc. from another thing they've already made, they will 1000% do it and just change up how it looks. Then they'll turn around and charge you like $30+ for the dlc which is the equivalent to highway robbery with what they actually give you, compared to, what you'd expect to actually receive. Don't even get me started with the numerous amounts of A.I. issues and other stuff this game has.... The only thing that can potentially make any of this worth it, at all, are the mods and the modding community. However, even that doesn't fix everything and adds/changes so much.

"This game is extremely fun and improves on a lot of key systems from the previous title at the expense of some truly baffling design decisions and bad performance optimization. While it is a definite buy if you're a fan of series, even in it's current state, this game will likely greatly improve over it's lifetime as immortal empires gets implemented, dlc comes out, and bugs get ironed out.

Factions:
Most of the new factions are excellent. Their rosters are varied, campaign/battle mechanics unique, and their overall presentation is spectacular. I particularly enjoyed playing Ogre Kingdoms and Kislev, the latter with which I am currently close to winning the campaign with. Both these factions are also a great showcase of the overall evolution of the Warhammer 2 formula, though they are diametrically opposed to each other in play style, both on campaign and battle. Kislev plays the best when building tall (not expanding too fast and building up their forces/settlements). Their faction mechanics of the Ice Court, Attomans, and Invocations of the Motherland facilitate this perfectly. The Ogres are best when playing wide, as their settlements cant go past tier 3. This forces you to rely on their Ogre Camp mechanic, which is a super novel addition that fits the character of the ogres and allows for completely unique gameplay. Khorne and Cathay also are very fun to play, though at the time of this review I'm less experienced with them, as I opted to play a couple longer campaigns to get an overall feel of how this game plays in the mid/later stages, as this is likely where players will spend most of their time. 

Campaign:
I prefer Realm of Chaos in TW:W3 to the Vortex in TW:W2. I know its not a high bar to pass, but I seem to be in the minority on this issue. Pretty much every realm except Khorne and possibly Slanesh (though this is only because the temptations offered are actually tempting) is a gigantic slog to get through and distract you from your plans in the mortal realm. I don't really have to much to say about it as most of your time will be spent playing as if the chaos realms didn't exist. All I can say is that when immortal empires comes out, just as in Warhammer 2 and mortal empires, I will pretty much be playing that exclusively. I do think the teleportation mechanic of the rifts is actually very fun though. 

Edit: I take this back. I have no intention of touching realms of chaos ever again, and vortex may have actually been less aggravating. Thankfully immortal empires is not longer locked behind a massive paywall for new players. Overall, immortal empires is a direct improvement to Warhammer 2's mortal empires in pretty much every way.

Battle:
If you've played TW:W2, then you know whats going on. Unit design in awesome, sound design in excellent (the battle music is a GIGANTIC improvement over 2), and your overall level of control feels about the same as the previous title. Magic, although still powerful, has to be used more sparingly due to a overhaul of the winds of magic system, a change I don't welcome. Unit animations seem to have taken a bit of side-grade as well, as although overall fighting animations have improved, there are far less cool unique interactions between fighting units and characters. 

Edit: unit pathing has gotten weirder, but its still pretty decent.

Sieges:
I'm mixed on these. I'm a little disappointed that they aren't what the devs promised, but they are still more fun than in the previous game, especially when it comes to minor settlements. Taking walled cities is a lot tough too, requiring a significant force if you want to forgo tedious cheese. Mostly, I like that settlements have better garrisons and defensible positions, allowing significantly less babysitting when enemy forces decide to pay you a visit. 

Performance:
Yikes. I have a 1080ti, a 8700k, 32gb of ram and am running the game at 3440x1440. When I invoke the motherland in Kislev I get <30 fps on the campaign map. Otherwise, I get about 35-45. This is bad, especially considering this isn't leaps beyond the visual fidelity of Warhammer 2. In battle, my FPS is actually pretty good, staying above 60 for the most part. Since the fps is perfectly adequate where in counts, I still find this performance acceptable. CA has stated that performance/stability will a priority in the coming patches, so we will see if this improves. 

Edit: this has been fixed for the most part.

Misc pro/con:
+ MASSIVE diplomacy rework. Everything about the old system has pretty much been gutted and a sleek ""quick deal"" option has been added to help you find quickly filter factions to politic with. Military alliances and defensive alliances are now a boon to your campaign and not a detriment, as allied factions won't drag you into stupid wars as often and provide tangible benefits such as outposts (these allow you to recruit units of friendly factions!) and far improved war coordination options. Region trading has also FINALLY been added. 
+ Character screen improvement. Its a lot easier to manage your characters' equipment and followers. 
+ Lords+heroes in armies now level from damage dealt/kills inflicted in battle. This is an excellent change, as the more difficult the battle, the more XP you get. This remedies a big issue with the previous stemming from how slow characters leveled up (usually once per battle, no matter how significant it was). In this game, I've earned five levels with a general once after taking on  two stacks of Nurgle and a garrison. 
- Tech trees are pretty bad. The benefits they provide have been heavily nerfed and make little difference.
- Some chaos units are shared reskins between the factions.","Gameplay Evolution, Technical Performance, Long-Term Value"

I love how diplomacy works with the new interface, making the task of making multiple actions with different factions much quicker and easier to accomplish. #3 also introduces a lot of quality of life improvements and cool game mechanics. Also, the return of unwalled town defenses is something that I truly missed in the first two games. Having the entire map open and filled with various factions is super cool. Graphics look great and show a marked improvement since #1. The tutorial is an entire mini-campaign in itself instead of a quick battle and, even as a Total War vet who knows how to play already, it was still well worth playing for the story and the fun scenario. As far as cons go, I can't say I've run into anything yet that really bothers me. It may happen still but, so far, I have no complaints.

The game is fun the tutorial is well made the main chaos mode is odd it rushes your on the campaign to do certain objectives to create artificial pressure but these objectives are not fun and will punish you with no way to circumvent it.

If you've played at least one Total War game, you already know nearly everything you need to know. If you liked it, it's a safe buy, if not, then keep away. 
That being said: at this point, it's pretty decent for a game that's out since two days. We've seen way worse games when it comes to both performance and content and I strongly expect both to get even better with time.

"Multiplayer game play has vastly improved with the new simultaneous turn system, which is great. I was really surprised they went to the effort and time to do it (considering people have been asking for it since the dawn of time), not only that but that it was implemented so well. Multiplayer campaigns with friends no longer take an hour to do 3-4 turns.                                                                                                                                                                   Unfortunately the new campaign is BS. It's different but not so enjoyable and the replay value just isn't there. The campaign is very limiting to a few armies, no conquering the world or friends, no large incomes etc. Just a giant 4 or part 5 quest to win, in which the computer/AI blatantly cheats.  The AI bypassing other factions they are at war with just to make a beeline straight for you is at worst game-breaking and best just straight up annoyingly stupid.                                                                                                                                                          The performance isn't good enough either. Bugs and the occasional crash on launch is fine but, it's fairly slow and stutters a lot.

very nice game,Overall Enjoyment
"Just completed my first campaign, and I'm now able to honestly review the game.

I honestly really enjoyed/enjoy this game!

The Prologue is absolutely amazing!

The campaign was for the most part really good, it has a lot of really fleshed out and intriguing characters and mini story lines that we all know and love from the Warhammer Lore.
There was a few minor elements of the campaign that weren't enjoyable (very minor) such as the settlement battles and the enemy AI which depending on what faction you play as can feel like a Terminator chasing you wherever you go (regardless of there own safety), but not to the point of making me want to stop!

There were a few bugs., wasn't a great issue and most I saw will most likely get scooped up in the next update or two. 
To be expected with a new release, not sure why people are whinging about this...

This game has released at such a great start point that when they do drop in Mortal Empires, it's going to make this games ""replay"" ability HUGE!

CA has a great record with its previous two titles in the Warhammer series, with frequent DLC additions that can expand and sometimes completely change the way the game can be played! 

Super excited to see what they bring with W3!

"Yeah, it's all right.

I especially like the wider range of diplomatic options and a more responsive control over your allies (as well as the fact that you now see where allies' armies are heading).

in itself i personally find it fun to play but with some factions you are completly luck reliant wheter or not you actually get to play the game like with boris since you either get to fight the entire chaos realm from turn 10 on or if you actually get to build up a bit so you can get all of the later units which some might call a skill issue but tbh idc cause i would like to be able to play on normal dificulty as a faction and not lose cause i got perma railed by the entire chaos realm just perma fcking me,"Gameplay Balance, Player Agency vs. Luck, Accessibility and Difficulty"

"Wonderfully done game that deserves its criticism but also has a lot to offer. The new factions are so different to play with their unique mechanism and they are very detailed.  The campaign has its problems but if you don't want to play it, you can fix with an easy mod. I truly believe this will be one of the greatest RTS ever made once all the content is released and IE is released.

Yeah CA released it early but its not a total mess like some people make it out to be. 

The games has so many wonderfully done mods by the community already and its only going to get better as time goes by and more and more content is added. 

Over time it will easily surpass TWW2 as the KING of the field.

I have a ""couple"" hours invested in this game and want to stress how important it is to maintain. Many much needed fixes took ages to materialize, and this is another problem that is glaringly obvious.

I made my review a positive one because I love this game and believe the point has been made by others.","Community Advocacy, Technical Quality, Long-term Support"
"TLDR at bottom
A prime time to write a review because of Current Controversy.
For further Interest I wrote a review for the Second one.

Pros
Hundreds of hours at least of game play(If you enjoy Total war games/Warhammer).
The people who code the game are cool people who seem to actually care, the same for the Lore writers.
Mods Mods Mods. You can get free factions, Free Maps, Free battle maps.

Cons
Total war games have been going downhill since Rome 1, So many features removed.
- Games are Simplified in every single new game that I have played.
---For example things that were in previous Total war games. 
*Actual population management.
*Naval battles (Of course these never made sense to me anyways so not much of a loss here but SOME people do want it)
*Every city could build every building if you could afford it, and resources were in its province.
*Cities had the buildings you built in their battle maps
*Unit Ai that was intelligent.(Opens paths for allied squads to run through, Would cycle front line with those ordered to attack the same unit to lower combat exhaustion)
*Unit and settlement Art.
*Battle deployables.
-This is pretty much Total War 1 Just with a different map and ""new."" Same engine as Napoleon?
*Really not upgrading engines instead of making a new one is not bad, but how much cost did they save? More on this later.
-Bugs never get fixed.
*Artillery and Ranged units not firing even with full clear line of sight.
*Ranged units Ramboing into melee because of LINE of Sight Errors only to get rocked hard by actual front liners.
*Some campaign missions just not being winnable due to bugs.(without mods that is)
*Some units not being able to be recruited by their Faction.

HOLY FRICK THEY FIXED THE ROLL FOR MORE WINDS OF MAGIC!

---The main Con that EVERYONE is upset at now. The con I addressed in my Review of Total war 2. Pricing.
It is outrageous. It has been outrageous how much they want to charge for a DLC. I tried haggling prices down saying Put new dlc down to 2$ Expecting them to meet me partway and put the DLCs at 7$-15$ (as I understood 2$ was never going to happen)Instead of 20-30$ per dlc. 
Also The Company Pretty much(Summed up by other members of the community) released a statement threatening to drop support for the game all-together if DLC is not bought at their pricing.

This is the I told you so paragraph ----V
-I have been told I do not matter because of this approach. We all look like idiots at some time in our life. I seemed stupid In my last review but It seems the people who perpetuated the Money game to this situation are the true fools who will now drown in their own filth at least for a while. You guys ruined it for everyone, and still have the gall to tell me that I am wrong and do not matter. Amazing

Total Price of Total war Warhammer 3 With all Races unlocks 440.77$

"What should have been Creative Assembly's crowning achievement has instead become one of its greatest embarrassments.  Not even accounting for its trainwreck of a release and miserable base game experience prior to Immortal Empires, Total War: Warhammer 3 is a perfect example of a game the developers and publishers care nothing for, other than enhancing their financial bottom line. 
Bugs and glitches that have existed since at least Total War: Warhammer 2 (I'm looking at you, gate bug) continue to persist, despite years of ""patching"".  Worse, the patch rate for the game is barely a hobble, with patches only coming out when major content updates occur.  This means bugs, like Nakai the Wanderer being unable to recruit Kroxigors (a lord who, I should remind you, was PAID DLC for Warhammer 2) persist for months at a time, despite the fix being proven by modders to be no more difficult than a single line of code.  There are HUNDREDS of problems, both minor and major, with the game that have existed for ages now and show no sign of being fixed or repaired. 
The price increase is the straw that broke the camel's back.  It's an out of touch, outright disrespectful change that proves what the fans have known for a long time: Creative Assembly doesn't care about their game, and they don't care about us.  The price increase would come with grumbling acceptance if, otherwise, CA showed any outward sign of caring for one of their most successful game series ever.  Instead, they continue to let their game be broken, while shovelling the bare minimum amount of content into a paid DLC, while bumping up the price with the excuse of ""increased costs"" as their only justification. 
Do not buy this game.  Do not play this game.  The developer and publisher don't care about this game, so neither should you.

EDIT: 
Coming to edit because Creative Assembly has not learnt their lesson.  They pretend to care by providing ""patches"" and ""bug fixes"" that instead introduce old or new issues that persist for MONTHS at a time with no acknowledgment.  This review was prompted by the (re?) introduction of a bug that prevents the AI for factions like the Lizardmen and Tomb Kings to do NOTHING.  At all.  They sit idly and allow the player and other factions to do as they please with no response at all.  CA did not acknowledge this until a certain major youtuber made a video on the issue; CA then released a statement pretending to care, pretending that this issue has been on their radar ""for some time"", and that we can expect it to be fixed at the end of October 2025. 
It has been about ten months since the Omens of Destruction DLC came out, and we have received little information on the Tides of Torment DLC.  One DLC a year for the only game actually bringing in revenue for CA is an abysmal rate of content release, almost insultingly low.  They have been almost radio silent on the DLC, likely because it has been messy or because this is the final DLC.  That is my suspicion, based on their lack of willingness to work on the game's problems and release information on this DLC or any future content. 
The siege ""rework"" will never be finished.  This series sieges have been a mess since game 1, and they never sorted it out.  All the changes they've made over the series life have been trivial at best, terrible at worst, and are indicative of a key trait of CA's development: they don't play their own game.  They throw changes out there and hope the community loves it.  
Do not buy.  This review will never change its rating because they will NEVER fix the issues that need to be fixed.  Sieges will remain broken, buggy, and unfun.  This game will never reach the potential shown when the series was first revealed.","Technical Stability, Developer Support, Consumer Value"

"Solid game! Bought full retail, no dlc, and I'm already happy with my purchase. Haven't played Total War since Rome/Shogun, and I was never super into it, but I find myself drawn to this one, the Warhammer Universe just suites it so well. Even just playing Cathay has given me tons of fun battles and opportunities to execute different strategies and improve control and battle tactics. With the challenging campaign map on default settings (for me), I've already gotten a good 100 hours out of this.

It's a shame they don't have cutscenes for assassinations and character actions, but I don't think they've had that since Shogun?

"Instead of being CA's magnum opus we get a game that is objectively less functional and arguably less enjoyable than TW:Warhammer II so SEGA can chase an already dead trend with Hyenas. A game nobody asked for, nobody wanted and will almost certainly be DoA.

Despite the immense size of Immortal Empires and the abundance of factions, magic and units, the experience itself becomes stale rather quickly. Once you've secured your starting area and built a couple of solid armies there is almost nothing left to challenge you as the AI is literally incapable of even trying to erect an Illusion of opposition. At turn 200 they'll be running around with crapstacks, happily yeeting them into your fortified cities just to slightly inconvenience you while you are busy sacking their main realm. The only AI factions that are actually able to snowball to endgame are the ones that are able to confederate as they get a massive boost, so have fun facing the same AI blobs in every lategame campaign.
Once you've dealt with them (which usually turns out to be extremely easy because the AI's armies are completely worthless) the game turns into a boring and tedious map painting simulator. 
The endgame crises, which were supposed to be these exciting scenarios that were going to challenge the player in unique ways also turned out to be worse than the Chaos Invasion from TW:WH I, as they literally just spawn a bunch of doomstacks within their Factions original realms. Very creative. 
Sieges and especially settlement battles are somehow worse than they were in Rome II, a game which released a decade ago.

I could go on and on, as I haven't touched on most of the games issues like the absurd amount of bugs, powercreep, lack of love for older factions and DLC price policy, etc. But I've already put in more work writing this review than CA has into actually polishing this game. At this point I can only hope the inevitable flop of Hyenas will finish the company for good so SEGA can finally take CA out back and shoot them. Perhaps a more competent developer will come along and pick up the IP and bring Total War back to it's former glory.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Depth, AI Competence"

"I bet my opinion of the game will improve significantly given time and the new grand campaign mode that is to come, but for now I have had so much difficulty with technical issues, messy AI, graphical oddities and overwhelmingly-downgraded UI that my opinion of this game is very negative. The amount of crashes I have had from alt-tabbing has made it difficult to want to open the game knowing that it will likely crash if I dare tab out to click on a YouTube video or something. The gameplay itself is pretty decent and I have had bouts of fun with it, but after having such a great experience with previous Total War: Warhammer titles that did not suffer from a plethora of weird problems this game feels like a downgrade, even alongside all of the improvements they have made to sieges, coop, etc. At the moment I wish they had simply added this game's factions as DLC for Warhammer 2 instead of releasing an entirely new game. I will eventually update this review to recommended when the problems get kinked out.

"If you've played the previous two games in the series or like Total War games in general, it is probably worth buying this game. I've seen some reviews complaining about it's quality as an RTS game, Total War games are turn based strategy games, they have real time battles, but are not really trying to compete in the RTS arena. If you are buying this as an RTS game, you are going to be disapointed. 

The new faction mechanics and updates to the campaign are mostly improvements and add variety from previous titles, but it did launch with bugs that while they haven't totally broken the game. The worst bugs and campaign quirks have been or getting fixed rapidly, but if you've never played a Total War game before you might want to pick up an older title and see if you like the genre first.

Biggest complaint so far is that the update/patching process invalidates in previously saved games, this has not happened previously in Total War games for every update and it's annoying it you don't have the time to sit down and play days at a time in one go.","Genre Expectations, Comparative Value, Technical Quality"

If you really read critical reviews of this game ill probably agree with 90% them without reading and it shocks me how many people blindly give this a thumbs up with under 300 hours titled ''game is good''.. we got scammed and screwed right over by C.A and you should expect future total war releases to be half baked unfinished messes with no thought or passion out into them. ive been waiting since the release for them to do right and fix this game or give us a true finale to the series and its seems its never going happen. don't buy this game until its 10 dollars on sale.","Consumer Value, Technical Quality, Artistic Direction"

"Bought this game and really fell in love with it. Overtime I bought all the DLC because I felt like I could play that game for a long while and wanted to show some support to the company for creating something that I really liked.

However, as time went by, I realised that the game contains a good amount of bugs. Some are more trivial than others and even though I believe that bugs are a part of developing a game, I feel like there's a lack of support by the company.

The last bug that got introduced with some good additional content basically broke 2 races (the AI does not do anything with those 2 races - it is a very critical bug), and we have been told by the company that it is gonna be fixed at the next DLC release which is in at least few weeks or even a month. I can understand that with new content, some things may not be working properly. What I cannot accept nor understand is when there's a critical issue being introduced, the focus and priority must switch on solving that issue instead of working on more additional content. At least if we had the ability to ""revert"" the changes but we do not. For these reasons, I am leaving a negative review.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Company Support"

"Well, what a waste of time.

I used to like this game a lot. I wanted to like it more than 2 because the Old World is my favourite of the Warhammer settings. Having so many of the factions is a real sweet treat. Unfortunately, it seems to be a detriment.

A combination of a buggy release, so many bugs remaining after patch after patch, cut content locked behind dlc, more network errors than even 2, dlc having less content than usual (Looking at you Shadows of Change) and CA’s piss poor handling of this debacle as pushed me to no longer wish to play this game. It’s a shame too, because it has wonderful QoL changes (such as 8 player multiplayer which is absolutely kickass), but unfortunately my issues listed above keep it from being truly awesome.

If you want any advice, I recommend playing the second Warhammer game. You’ll get a solid map that doesn’t have as many issues running and you’ll also get an actual working game.

EDIT 1: Since my initial review, the game has gotten much better. It is now a a point where it is better than the second one.

EDIT 2: CA is something else.","Technical Stability, Content Value, Developer Support"
"Been playing since WH1 (OG Rome TW more specifically). Lots of potential but very minimal work is being put into hotfixes and additional content, and there is no free content added that is worthwhile compared to WH2. No groundbreaking innovations compared to its predecessor. I've played a few campaigns at release, Daemons are fun, except you Nurgle, then I waited for Immortal Empires. It ended up being a mess.
So I've waited months for things to get better, and watched from afar if their bugfixes and big content promises would be done. They did not. How surprising considering 3K patches, and they were better.
Chaos Dwarves got released at last for 25 euros. Maybe I'd have bought it later on when I might have played again, but it's quite expensive for an expansion. 25 euros is the cost of Hades, a very polished game with more replayability than a new faction. Then the new DLC price got leaked and it became clear by that point I had lost all interest in the game as it is, and TW in general. The leak was true, 3 lords and a skeleton crew of units. For 25 euros. Might probably be the combined price of both Hades and its coming sequel.

There is no point buying this game now, it's disgustingly expensive, buggy and unfinished. There are no cheap DLC deals for newcomers offered, and if you didn't buy them one release after an other like I was able to, that's a tremendous amount of money.

Try it later, much later, when the patch cycles are finished and *community* hotfixes will have fixed game breaking bugs affecting previous DLCs (looking at you Kroxigors, Ariel). 
Maybe CA will finally understand that actively continuing development of a game is better and safer for both their consumer base and themselves money and trust wise, and take notes from Larian Studios. They should. Because they've lost what little goodwill was left after what they did to Three Kingdoms with this.

"This is a good game. I will say though, that i much prefer TWWH2 for various reasons and i will go into those below. 
Pros:
 - New races
 - New race-specific mechanics
 - New campaign that almost exclusively shows you all the new races and mechanics
 - ""Simultaneous"" turns are nice, but you are limited from various things at times or are whipped out of commands when battles start and such. Can't diplomacy while waiting for turn to end, etc. (also a con)
Cons:
 - Graphics when not in battle are inferior compared to legacy games, tend to be pastel/crayon looking and have odd filters
 - New races negate many things from legacy races, example is that old character duelists are now useless against lords larger than them (Queek is now awful)
 - New races (to my taste) are generally just not fun to deal with, large problem in main campaign, but not as large of a problem in Immortal empire campaigns","Gameplay Mechanics, Visual Design, Comparative Balance"

"Edit as of 11.10.2025:
Well, I guess I was being quite naive, thinking that CA has somehow learned from their past mistakes and has actually started to try earn some trust back. As it stands, this game is a mess, and even though as a High Elves enjoyer I was extremely looking forward to the next DLC, I think I will pass. If CA does not have any respect towards its actual consumers, who buy the product, then I see no point in financially supporting them anymore.

I thought this game was important to them, being their current biggest title, raking a lot of income and all, but I guess not. Well, keep up at this, CA, and you can be sure you will lose all your customer base. I do not think I will be buying any new title.

I will keep the older review here, just to remind myself not to trust them that easily again.

CA has made some effort to actually address the underlying issues of this game. Patches are now more frequent, DLCs have also stepped up in quality. So, for now, I cautiously reccomend this game. However, the state of the game and more importantly, CA's approach was so, so bad I am not deleting my original review. CA still has to do a lot of work to get my goodwill back. For now, I am cautiously optimistic, but wary.

While this game is fun, with immense amount of content, races, playstyles and therefore replayability, I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game to any new players, because of the awful state it is in right now. There are myriads of bugs that have gone unaddressed now for months. You cannot enjoy some of the additional payed content, as for example Ariel is impossible to recruit in Wood elves campaigns, Nakai cannot recruit his signature unit, and so on. The worst part is that the company is very well aware of all of those issues and more, but they seem to not care at all. This is absolutely insane and unacceptable - such anti-consumer practices should never be tolerated.
So, until the company drastically changes its policy and actually delivers on the promise of frequent patches and hotfixes that would lead the game out of this dark forest full of bugs that it is currently in, no new players should even think of investing into this.
Also, the new pricing for DLCs is so over the top, it feels like a slap in the face to the community.

Edit as of 10.11.: The company has fixed some of the most egregious bugs, but the game is still far from being in an ok state. Also, to top it all off, their communication towards the community has become so arrogant I am starting to wonder whether they actually want their company to fail. Right to discuss is not a privilege, CA, it is my right as a customer I gained by buying your game. Get yourselves together fast, CA, or you will be left with no customer base.","Consumer Value, Company Trust, Product Quality"

"So I'd thought I'd post this whilst I'm playing it so I can try and remember at least half of everything that's terrible and sucks with it. The list is long.

From retarded units that just don't follow orders and do really random stuff to consistently lose you battles in otherwise easy conditions to win... down to the horrible Clash of Clans copy (at around £100 a pop).

Seriously this game is the worst of every Total War ever made. Just don't buy it. Ever.

The controls are Janky at best and units following instructions is kind of total RnG. I've got hours of recorded footage of telling archers to shoot at units and they just glitch out on the spot for a few minutes trying to change direction or formation into something that just makes no sense or wasn't requested. Again, usually at a time when you need something to do what you tell it to.

Lost the same siege battle 4 times over with mechanised units driving into trees and just staying there without response to new directions, threats or the 400 enemy troops just strolling past next to you.

Seriously, above all else the completely awful unit A.I. makes this game just unplayable... tell a unit to attack something, it'll change direction and formation for 10 minutes, then walk off in a random direction and stand next to the unit you told it to attack.

Getting units to attack Hero's is even worse. It's like your units do a little dance around the target for 15 minutes whilst they all die.

EDIT: - Sorry I forgot to add that the CPU doesn't play by any of the same rules that you do. So 10 turns in it'ss apear with 2 x 20stacks of units generated from a single town with 3 buildings... Completely impossible in any of the game mechanics... You can tell when someone has made a really unbalanced non-working bag of crap when the AI is just coded to ignore all game constraints and just throw massive armies at you whenever and however required... usually crap in your units vs CPU units as well in terms of how they behave etc. in battle... loads of completely stupid movements by your own units to aid the CPU at just the right times...

Please for god sake don't buy this game. Grab yourself a £89 parachute instead and try Base Jumping. It's less painful.

EDIT : You could throw a bag of razor blades and a few pints of Vinegar into the sky dive mentioned above and still be good... I wouldn't play this anymore if I was paid to. THere are £4 indie games with just way more to offer...

Well done CA - Waited 4 years for the final on this title and you turned it into an unbalanced, Jankie, Cheap feeling, Overpriced Clash of Clans copy... Outstanding work...

BTW - Whichever idiot OK'd the £100 a copy Tower Defence Game... Please ****ing sack them. Worst RTS game ever made.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Mechanics, Consumer Value"

"The game ""Total War: Warhammer 3"" is not good. The culmination of all the previous games and their paid DLC as ""Total War: Warhammer: Immortal Empires"" is amazing. This is an investment, a very expensive investment. The game by itself is not good, and all its content is locked behind paid DLC. The game even came out with pre-order paid DLC, and then months later the factions that you bought the game for also have units locked behind more paid DLC. Do not Buy this game, or any Total War: Warhammer game/DLC at full price. Check everywhere you can for discounts. None of the content is worth the full asking price. 

All that aside, after you have forked over money for the content, it is ""good."" The game has many bugs and factions have varying levels of uniqueness, power, and content. Immortal Empires is a mashup of games from up to 7 years ago, and you can tell when playing it. Luckily those games were very good, so the experience over all is good.

"I love the franchise, I love warhammer, and I love strategy battle games. There truly is no gaming experience quite like a Total War Campaign. 


Unfortunately, this entry into the series has been wholly without heart on the part of Creative Assembly. Warhammer 1 and 2 were both well received, and the studio limped into the finish line with this absolutely uninspired installment. The release was terrible, the updates have been glacial, and the ""improvements"" in the game since release have largely been lateral moves.


Don't get it twisted - this game is getting review bombed, but not JUST because of CA's latest chicanery. This is the final straw for a lot of us who have watched CA fritter away its opportunity to make this into the game that this franchise deserves. If I believed for one second that my money would actually go to the stewardship of this game, I would continue to buy full priced DLC happily, but it is clear that CA would rather leave a skeleton crew with minimal resources supporting their flagship title.

"It's a really great way to play Total War, once you have everything. The world itself is really interesting and pulled me into it, finding ways to cheese the game or just do well with classic military strategy is deeply satisfying, and the variety of factions make the Immortal Empires campaigns endlessly replayable. 

Get the lot in the biggest sale you can, as the game is really all three TW:WHs stitched together. The campaign specific to this game is nothing special, and its unique mechanics aren't that interesting. Immortal Empires lets you play as any of the legendary lords from all of the factions released from the first TW:WH to this one - provided you have each game and its respective DLC, anyway - one a world-sized map. I played a few campaigns before finishing the collection and often felt like something was missing, only to find out later a DLC picked up later on had the exact kind of units I wished was there.

"I have only played the intro/Tutorial campaign of TW: W III, after playing a couple hundred hours each of TW: WI and TW:W II.  Story of the campaign was fine, but I didn't like the UI changes with the third instalment of this series.

Specifically, I did not like the changes to the item equip menu/screen.  In TW:II, the dropdown menus for each item type made it easy to review: a) what items were available for each slot; b) what each of these items did; and, c) who currently had particular items equipped.  While the current screen may be more aesthetically pleasing, I found it did not communicate information as clearly or easily as the old system.  Even in the tutorial campaign, managing items across characters felt like more of a chore.  YMMV, of course.

On that note: if you are looking to jump into the series, I suggest buying your collection somewhere other than Steam.  As of writing, I have put only 4 hrs, 36 mins into TW:W III over two days of play (to give a fulsome play of the tutorial, to make sure I wasn't unfairly bouncing off of the newest iteration just because it is the newest).  This is, I believe, the first Steam refund I've asked for.  It was repeatedly rejected, apparently automatically, with a short statement that it didn't meet the 14/2 rules for automatic refunds.  Despite me repeatedly taking time to point out that Steam's own policy claims that refund requests *that don't meet the 14/2 rules* will still be looked at, and despite noting the significant play time required to *finish the tutorial campaign*, compared to other games.   So, cavaet emptor.","User Interface Design, Comparative Gameplay Experience, Information Clarity"

"+Cool setting. Amazing characters. Different playstyles. Many cool units. Very well voiced.
+++Incredible mod support. Half of what I like about the game has come from one or another mod. Game is great without it but after you install some of the mods you kind of start feeling they are mandatory for your playthroughs.

-Ridiculously dumb AI, resource intensive, bland combat encounters due to bad AI
---CA (the developers) gets very dumb every couple months, then they are cool. That's just a toxic relationship, but you stay because the good times are great.

Overall it's a great game. Buy DLC when on sale. Game is great if you are into the setting, are a fan of fantasy or guns. If you are only in it for gameplay then it's more of a 6/10 meh.

"Bigger, but definitely not better than the second game.

Quite a lot of bugs (Nakai can't recruit Kroxigors, problems with Ariel, LoS of ranged units etc.) and ""unfinished"" content, that desperately need revisiting (e.g. generic skill trees of many older characters don't even have enough skills for all 49 skill points - really annoying in the endgame when level-up notifications pop up - promised to be fixed in 2022, but who cares).

Sieges and AI are still bad and it looks like they don't have any good idea how to make them better, because rework was bad. Immortal Empires, while big and looks fantastic, becomes dull after 50-70 turns. There is lack of side goals or content, only one big sandbox where you paint the huge map.

Upcoming DLC costs 50% of the full game, brings less content to the table than normally and they justify that by saying ""their costs are up"". Their revenue almost tripled in the last 5 years and they make £6m profit.

"Very dodgy launch, lack of sandbox is very frustrating, and certain issues such as far too many siege battles that have to be played as the auto resolve function has been balanced to make you suffer more losses. Campaign also lacks massive replayability and has some annoying mechanics, though those have largely been patched out by now. 

All that being said, the game is still a boat load of fun, animations and unit designs are gorgeous and the individual factions are awesomely unique. I'm having a lot of fun, and ontop of that i have a pretty crappy rig too (last and most modern piece of kit in it is a GTX 1060), though the game easily runs well enough to enjoy. While siege battles get repetitive the battles and fighting in the game is still badass and the new settlement battles are a MASSIVE improvement on TWW2,though some people dislike the tower system, and I certainly would have preferred a system based around other tools like barricades, fire pits etc as in previous tw titles. 

It's in a problematic place, though still worth it in my book, hundreds of hours of fun still to be had and a ton more content to come as well that will keep you busy. The issues many people report about I personally haven't found to be that invasive in my enjoyment of the game at all, and the modding community is already cranking out plenty of cool stuff on TWW3 if your into that side of things as well.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Experience, Visual Design"

"So, a response was finally given to us by CA about the unjustifiable pricing of the Shadows of Change dlc.
To sum it up: ""shut up, buy it and be grateful"".
Its the same cost as a racepack, but with the content of a lordpack (and NO, including bug fixes for things YOU broke FROM THE LAST GAME doesn't count as price-justifying content. Embarrassing that was used as an argument btw). It's genuinely so disappointing that such a phenomenal setting bound to such a strong and engaging game formula is fostered by a company like CA. 
They're just looking to subsidize the cost for their dumb Hyenas game that's gonna fail, CA community managers are doing their best but of course all of the fallout lands on their heads and none of it on the greedy corporate troglodytes wasting the company resources on a trend-chaser bound for failure.

I will not be buying this DLC until it is on a heavy sale, and if CA keeps up I will not be purchasing anything from them ever again. I have 1600 hours on WH2 and almost 400 on WH3, along with every dlc, and this is enough to push even me away.

The Dark Elve nerfed slave system feels bad because they were my favourite Faction in TW:WH2. I still love the Black Arcs but their economy is considerably weaker now and public order harder to maintain due to it beeing a global debuff instead of a local one now.

Also the Chaos Dwarf DLC feels overpriced for the amount of content it contains, but considering that CA removed the requirements to have TW:Wh1 and 2 for the full Immortal Empire access, they have to make their money via DLC prices i guess.","Modding Community & Accessibility, Gameplay Balance & AI, DLC Value & Business Model"

"Let me tell in the beginning what I'll tell as the conclusion: This game does not deserve its Mixed rating. It's currently a good game, with potential to be the greatest Total War game with the inclusion of Immortal Empires, race DLCs, some bugfixes, tweaks and performance improvement.

The biggest criticism to the game right now is how the campaign narrative plays: travelling to the chaos realm and completing missions there. I agree that completing a realm feels unrewarding afterwards (compared to the trouble you take), but the realm idea in general is really cool. Another related criticism is the campaign being on a timer: you're in a race with other factions. I really understand that people enjoy sandbox experiences more, but that is for Immortal Empires update. We all knew that WH3 would launch with a more narrative, race campaign, like WH2. And I can see no degradation from Race for the Vortex campaign of WH2.

After this, the following are pros and cons of WH3 in my opinion, coming from someone that really liked WH2.

Pros:
[list]
[*] For the first time in TW WH trilogy, siege battles are fleshed out.
[*] In the older games, making military alliances was only meaningful with superpowers. This time, the allegiance mechanic makes it useful and super interesting to make more alliances. If nothing, I really liked the idea of incorporating my fav units from different races into my armies.
[*] The game introduces 8 new races that capture the detail that we're used to from WH2, with very unique units and interesting faction mechanics. So more of the same standard in that regard, which is a plus.
[*] UI and accessibility is greatly improved. Your units are more visible, their cards convey more information (like when they are idle), selecting a spell slows down the game seamlessly - making it easier to cast.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] While they have an interesting concept, I didn't find playing survival battles fun. Note that you have to play only a handful of them, if you don't autoresolve.
[*] Completing realms at the moment is very unrewarding. Plus, the Tzeench realm feels very unfair to compete against the AI.
[*] Performance is not as good as WH2.
[*] It shouldn't be that you plow through in Hard campaign difficulty, but deal with endless hordes of enemies in Very Hard. The difficulties should be better organized.
[*] Especially the Chaos factions have a limited number of units, which will undoubtedly be addressed in DLCs - but it's still a negative in the current state.

"Very good fantasy war simulation game with good graphics, epic music, and high mod support in both singleplayer and multiplayer. It got a lot of great improvements to gameplay of previous installments. The main campaign is a decent story, though not as good as Total War:Warhammer 2 Vortex Campaign. 

But the main mode to play is the Immortal Empires mode, that expands the map to cover all 3 games and factions in one scenario. If you own the previous games or dlcs, you can play as the factions from those games. Otherwise you can only play as the Total War:Warhammer 3 factions. Immortal Empires is an amazing experience not found in other games.","Gameplay Experience, Content Value, Technical Quality"

All the TWW3 base game races are extremely varied and well designed so you can have a lot of fun with all of them and they are really interesting and goddamn fun to play. Also how could I not give this game an amazing review I've nearly got half my hours of TWW2+TWW1 combined on it and its only really been out a year... But this game is gonna keep getting better and better with all the new amazing DLC we are gonna get as you can see from whats coming super soon with the Chaos Dwarf bois (Also some Legendary Heroes included!!!). Also I'd say all the DLC for all 3 games combined are ridiculously well made especially Champions of Chaos!!

"When the game works it is good fun. Especially when playing multiplayer, the Immortal Empires is a great sandbox that never plays the same way twice. The only issue is the desyncs, it is very inconsistent. Some games we can go hours without a desync but others we can't even start without desyncing back to back(we gave up on mods a while ago).

Great game but it is surprising how often the game desyncs.

"this is not a product worth 60€ at this moment. For 60€ i expect a polished and most importantly *Finished* game, not a fucking early access game being marketed as a full release. On the higher graphic settings the ui looks like crap, when zooming out on the battle map small units like Nurglings turn into shapeless blobs of colour which is frankly unacceptable in a 60€ game with like years of development. During the Prologue the game softlocked twice on me as i didnt act exactly as the tutorial intendet. apart from that during normal campaigns i have also been softlocked a number of times, for example in my most recent campaign (as Tzeentch) the chaos rifts straightup do not spawn preventing all factions from gaining demon souls and completing the campaign (it has been 140 turns and none have shown up), It has also crashed on me several times already. And speaking of the demon souls mechanic, i absolutly hate it. the survival battles are a massive slog and genuinly unfun in my opinion. On a positive note i quite like the customisation of the demon prince but his campaign is arse as the AI has such massive player Bias that it feels all but impossible to even leave your starting province as you just run along the coastline facing twenty stack after twenty stack and FUCKING KOSTALTIN all the time. This game doesnt feel like a 60€ game release this feels like a 20€ early access title you backed for some reason you cannot remember anymore. This is a straight downgrade fro, WH 2. Not worth 60€ and CA should be ashamed for thinking that its ready for release.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Visual Quality"

"The latest DLC is the straw to break the back, I was waiting and waiting for the fixes and post launch love that never came. 
After always have the latest TW game downloaded and usually spending 100s of hours on each, this is the first one I uninstalled, the price hike of the same watered down DLC was enough. I did not mind the game on release but the love has gone for the series and I could not get the feeling of wanting to play, despite loading the game and starting a new Campaign, an hour later I would turn the game off, the bugs (some of which would crash my PC after winning battles on certain maps). The overall dullness of the campaign amazed me how my favourite game WH2 could be turned so boring. 

Awkwardly there is a UK branch of Total war CA in my home town that I have to see and laugh at on my way to visit family. 

I hope CA can make a game that can reintroduce me to the series and get the love back, at a price available to all. Nobody is going to buy this over the current games coming out for this price!","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Gameplay Engagement"

"Is this game perfect, no, is this game perfectly polished to a shine, no. Honestly, that's okay. The game is stable but not quite optimized, it eats up performance like a monster but this will change, the game is 100% playable (in a good way) right now. 

Races are fun and all differentiated from each other, it's a strong foundation. The campaign story quests are a little unforgiving for little reward (very in theme for Warhammer though) which drags down the gameplay a little. Despite this, it's still a blast, bugs aside, it's still a blast! I completely understand concerns about bugs, they exist and they will get squashed. I understand concerns about optimization, but I haven't seen it.

If your worried about performance, pull up the prologue and see how far you can get, if that doesn't work, than you know how the rest of the game is going to run. All else aside, the game is a blast! I recommend it to fans now, but for new people, worried about issues, waiting will only make it sweeter!

The experience in the story campaigns from a Single Player experience are great. Able to keep myself entertained, even though I am not a single player gamer. Definitely up there for best game of the year so far. Any other releases have a high bar to mantle. Do yourself a favor and get the game, especially if your friends have it as well!","Multiplayer Experience, Single Player Experience, Overall Recommendation"
"I like the game, aside from the poor launch, but updates have felt slow and infrequent. There have been some good updates such as not having to fight minor settlement battles where its basically capture the flag EVERY minor settlement whether it has walls or not. 

Unfrotunately, as much as I like the game, WH3 has been a far drop from the state the game was in at the end of WH2. I personally felt the DLC was very reasonably priced to the point where I bought it even if I didn't want it. Now it feels like the price of the DLC has been increased massively and disproprtionately. It is a bit better now that they seen to be carving up the DLC and letting you buy the race updates separately, but it's still expensive. You can literally buy whole games for the price of some new units and lords. There's less content that the updates in WH2 and it costs more. they want their cake and to eat it. 

Not to mention the constant issues with bugs and glitches. The game isn't updated that frequently and when it is, it feels like they should have accomplished a lot more in the time. And when new content is prioritised over fixing issues with the game, it feels like the directors see our money as an entitlement rather than something they need to convince us to part with.

"I have purchased every Total War game since Shogun 1 (except Medieval 1).  I have every DLC for the Warhammer series and bought them all upon release.  I really love this game and the franchise.  The truth is I don't think Creative Assembly loves this franchise.  They have fallen in love with the money, taking the revenue from this series to fund other projects.  That was fine when they were still pouring their time and effort into their flagship series.  Now though, they have raised their DLC to $25 for 3 legendary lords and hardly any FLC.  Half the base game for a fraction of the content.  The base game is buggy, and I frankly rely on the modders to make the game be in a state I enjoy playing it (check out SFO--Venris is the best).  I want this game to succeed, but not like this.  I would love to remove this review if CA decides to try to regain some of their goodwill back.  Until then....sad day...

UPDATE:  Thrones of Decay has released and the work CA put in has improved quite a bit.  I will update my review upon the next DLC--if it is of the same caliber.  I want this series to succeed and purchased ToD, but I also want to ensure this wasn't just a fluke.  Keep it up CA :)

When this game came out.  I had some issues with the game design that I was not much a fan of.  Issues that stood since WH1 and also WH2.  To date; most of those issues have been corrected or at least improved.

I will say that this game is very little challenge.  Because I can save and load game, whenever.  There is no IronMan mode.

With that being said.  I find this game to be a LOT OF FUN!
It has huge variety and options.  Creative.  Decent mechanics.  And almost all the DLC; I find are fun for me.  I always get them on sale.  Always.

I like this game.  I play it often. 
Immortal Empires, is my fav to play.  I play full Domination Campaigns.  Loooooong games.  But great fun.  I win.

"So as you can see by my hours I love this game, I love Total War as a franchise in general, and I have always had the mindset of ""Let them fix it when they can"" but this has gotten simply ridiculous. I don't blame the devs working on the game for not being able to fix every little bug or accidentally creating new issues. However I do blame the management, and publisher for not putting enough resources into this game. This is an ACTIVELY played game, one of the most popular strategy games, and series of the last 20 years and it's going down the drain. Give the team more staff and some more resources, how can you expect any of us long term fans to buy the next TW, or DLC when you've proven again and again that modders have to fix the game for you?","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Developer Support"
"This game is definitely a step back from where we were in Warhammer 3.  The things that were bad about that game's campaign (the Vortex rituals) only got worse (in the form of portals).  But then they took an enormous step backwards with changes to settlement battles.  Every battle now is a siege; maybe 1 out of 5 battles is in the field, and now the game just feels like a total slog. The only real way I see this getting fixed is if they just the garrison building chain for minor settlements into an actual settlement battle, rather than giving them walls. Then, if you don't have the garrison building chain, minor settlements just cause a field battle instead.

The changes to settlements make the game drastically more difficult, and when every battle is a siege, it very rapidly stops being fun.","Gameplay Design, Comparative Progression, Player Experience"

"When the game started out it had a lot of problems and over the time it has mainly gotten more problems, one of the biggest is that the game has simply become too easy, power creep since release over the course of many DLC releases means that even playing on the very hardest difficulty giving the AI serious cheats you might not be challenged all that much, there's items giving you +50% campaign movement speed now where 5% used to be a desirable buff, there's bonuses that gives more movement upon winning battles and other such trivialising the campaign, you have to actively go out of your way to avoid them or avoid dlc units that are mostly just a straight upgrade from vanilla faction units. 

Lately ofcourse there's been the dead faction lords problem not moving around, that's got people riled up as well though it's nothing new, it does feel as if the priority here is to release new content and make money while keeping staff working on the rest at an absolute minimum to focus on making the newer titles like 40K, you get where they're coming from but you know they're going to want to package all the DLC under a 'Definitive Edition' some day and that's going to be a hard sell to people since, it's gonna be expensive and they're going to see the reviews aren't great, that's not a good combination, probably should consider the game at some point, best time to do so was before 1.0 but better late than never.","Gameplay Balance, Technical Performance, Content Evolution"

"So ive been playing a decent amount again the past week or so and I have to say that its nice they stuck with it and ironed out a lot of the issues I had at launch. While still not perfect there have been some major improvements that really allows me to enjoy the game again.

Another positive thing is that CA seems to have learned from their previous years where there was controversy after controversy (Pricing of dlcs, content, etc...). While the jury is still out on if they will keep it up I think the the last 2 dlc releases have been great (Written as of the release of Omens of Destruction). 

After a long time of disliking the game and the way CA has been acting I can say that I would recommend the game in its current state and im hoping for more improvements/dlc that fleshes out the game even more.

Edit for 25-10-2025:
I honestly cant recommend the game with all its problems and power creep. I would wait before getting it and see if CA is able to fix the problems that plague this game or get it on sale.

I love the Warhammer total war series but in all honesty i would wait before buying WH3. 
There are major issues with the game and with the slow release of updates (or even dlc) just makes it so I cant recommend the game in its current state.

IF they wanted to release DLCs they should have but WHAT HAPPENS when HALF the product is made available on RELEASE DATE, YOU CAN PLAY LESS THAN HALF THE GAME RIGHT NOW.
I am waiting for mortal empires yes but the campaigns in itself have been BORING. I AM GOING BACK TO wh2!!!! there is no fun in the small map currently available. Shame on you CA.

love this game easily my favourite game it has great strategy in the battles and campaign with a massive amount of variety with all the different factions you can play the lords are interesting with loads of different ways you can approach using them from building them up and sending them in alone to wipe out armys to being a main healer/support for the rest of your army in battle the items provide a nice extra bonus to it as well to hype spec more into whatever you decide to do with them. units themselves are very diverse with many different ones that all focus on a different thing for example if i want a Calvary like unit i can go for any monster any mounted units any flying mounted units or maybe even a lord i decide to put on a horse and all of them even serve different purposes some are anti infantry some are anti large some grant you just different sort of buffs such as fire weapons and what not for your warriors. ive put 800 hours into the game basically and most of that time was just into two factions (i love playing wood elves so much that it might be bad for my health) overall great game with a premise the game can be buggy at times for example the most recent shinangans with ai but they have patched it out. the dlc in this game is undefendable though way to much money for the amount of things they give i recommend always waiting for a sale if you wish to get any of them.,"Gameplay Depth, Strategic Variety, Character Customization"

Can't play anymore, too bad for you.

In case you don't want to lose your save file because of the developers' incompetence, the only solution I've found is to literally go into the game's code and make it so it's impossible for the AI to win the final battle. Thanks CA.

Instructions for saving your campaign if you end up in my situation: Download RPFM. Look for the Data folder in the game's directory. Inside is a file named data.pack. Open this using RPFM (you may want to back this up in case you mess up and brick your game). Once inside navigate to script>campaign>wh3_main_chaos>realms>wh3_realm_common.lua. Look for the line that says ""local strength_required_for_ai_to_complete_realm = 2000000;"".

"I've played the Total War: Warhammer franchise games from the first release, every DLC, and now the third installation. Combined between Warhammer one and two, I have 4100 hours played (I lead a really rewarding life I swear).

I've now put 120 hours into Total War: Warhammer III and my review is this:

The game is not ready. It's an unfinished product with very clear flaws and unfinished parts of the game. Some systems are distinctly worse, or are actually regressions from improvements made in Total War: Warhammer II. After looking at the road map that CA has released, it's clear that this was a very premature release (giggity). I am so freaking tired of half-baked versions of games being released as 'full, completed, and finished' games that spend the next year being patched into a playable and fun experience. That's not a finished game. That's a work in progress. This should have been released as early access, NOT a final release.

Is it a terrible game? No. Is it a vast step down from the second game? Absolutely.

My first complaint is the lack of polish on the battle auto resolve system. I play on Legendary, and I get it. It's supposed to be hard. What I cannot stand, and intensely despise, fake difficulty. This system is a perfect example of fake difficulty. Having to manually fight every single rebellion in my faction, the same way every time, and having to waste hours of my time fighting the exact same battles over and over and over again S U C K S. In the same vein as the rebellions is some random five or ten strength 'army' wading into my lands and teleporting around in the case of Tzeench armies, and laying siege to my settlement. Not being able to autoresolve the battle with my 14-20 army garrison that I should always win, and usually win with very minimal casualties, is infuriating. This isn't difficulty, that's tedious nonsense. Some factions have no hope of avoiding rebellions, such as Slaanesh, and I wound up straight quitting my campaign at about 100 turns in because I just couldn't do it anymore.

The second is the 'new' trait system, which is quite literally just the same trait system from Warhammer I and II before they FIXED IT. 

Why? ... WHY?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!?!?!?!

After multiple years of complaining that if your lord wasn't a Disciplined lord they were borderline worthless, we finally got updated traits for lords that actually made them unique and interesting. Wanted a fighter lord? There were finally traits that meaningfully improved their personal statistics. Wanted a lord that focused on buffing the army? We had traits for that, and so on. Why did CA decide to revert that change and go back to a far inferior, less rewarding system that was changed BECAUSE of negative feedback about how bad it was? 'Power creep'. What a lame duck excuse in a single player game. Honestly, I never once heard anyone complain about 'power creep' regarding the lord traits. The changed system in Warhammer II was celebrated and breathed life into otherwise copy-paste bland lord systems. Reverting this change was a very poor decision, and I was extremely disappointed when I opened the lord recruit screen and saw the old trait system again.

Third is the pathing of units and some units dropping commands, getting trapped, or otherwise just not attacking properly. There are some units, like chasing units (such as war dogs, etc), that literally can't do their job because their targeting is absolute trash. They get stuck behind a few units at the back of the unit because they're all auto-locked onto the unit at the 'front' of retreating units, and almost never even actually attack or kill anything. Their one job. Also the ranged units are messed up almost across the board. Most of the time the whole set of units won't fire, or if they're docked on the sides of the city defenses only the first row fires. It's awful.

My final complaint is just the lack of polish on the game as a whole. There are some really cool new additions in this game, but there are a lot of things that took gigantic leaps backwards. It feels like all the improvements Warhammer II made were completely scrapped for no reason, and it's just tragic to see. Instead of just importing the changes Warhammer II made into Warhammer III, now we have to go through the whole process all over again, and I'm just not into it. This just ain't it, chief. I've never asked or even thought about trying to ask for a refund about any game, but I seriously considered it for this one. This is not a completed game. The varnish wears off after about the first ten hours, and if you're a veteran of the franchise you're just left disappointed and annoyed.

"Despite a few minor bugs, the game is in an excellent state. The AI is borderline cheating, particularly on higher settings, offering a significant challenge for the masochists if you don't cheese the mechanics. Visually, the game is stunning, though it does have some performance issues. I will caveat this with the acknowledgement that some of the DLCs are overpriced, however, going on the latest DLC CA has released, they appear to be listening to the fans and making them worth the money in my opinion.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Challenge, Consumer Value"

"There is a ton of content in this game. It is aided by owning the other games to get all of the toys from the previous games. Heroes and unit variation makes the game a little different every time and kept me engaged through my 186 hours of play. I have been playing total war since Rome total war and own almost all the games in this series. I think that the over the top nature of this game is the reason I keep coming back. I also appreciate that CA have kept lore in mind during the creation of factions, heroes, and campaigns. 

I do kind of dislike some of the DLC practices. What I mean by this is there is just a mammoth amount of it and to get all of the content you would have to spend something like $300. That being said, they have also given away a ton of free stuff to the community and seem to really care. 
You will experience bugs and you will find yourself frustrated. However you may also find a game that will keep you coming back for years to come!","Content & Value, Monetization & DLC, Lore & World-Building"

"Agree with most negative reviewers. The game really punishes you during the chaos rift invasions. If you like puzzle-like games, this might be your cup of tea. But if you play Total Warhammer because you wanted the previous experience of becoming the badass of anything that has a tooth and an eye-socket? You're in for a treat, but the Hansel and Gretel version.

In this game, half the time you're trying to manage a choke point and, oh... 3000 units camped outside your doorstep? Why? Because when the rifts pop-up and you can't close them in time... well... enjoy the bloodbath, but remember, those are your organs on that pretty 4K resolution mountain. And WHILE monsters of every habitat trample joyfully on your hard-earned cities, your neighbour sees a wonderful opportunity to pay your towns a permanent visit. 

Not enough pain for the masochist in the room? Don't forget the chaos gods and their pain-in-the-#@^% domain maps. If the puzzles in those chaos realms aren't enough to take you away from your world domination, we have an added hour-long session with each God. And IF you survive, you can be fairly certain that you're going to be crippled, debuffed, half-lifed and... oh, hey neighbour. :(","Gameplay Challenge, Genre Alignment, Strategic Management"

"Early review after playing for two days. Will delete/update if opinion changes. So far the game has been very enjoyable but has some rough spots.

First, I'll talk about what I don't like so I can get it out of the way and try to end on a more positive note.
-The Campaign Soft timer: It's a god damn race and even worst then the vortex race. Unlike the vortex campaign there is no way to stop a faction from progressing to the end goal before you without declaring war on them and manually marching a army over to kick their butt. You can use rifts to teleport over to the area they have to go, but nothing stops them from trying again and again. I was planning as Slannesh and the Ogre kingdoms got all the mcguffins and I had no way to stop them short of keeping a army posted on the forge at all times.

-Stability: I have a 3090, AMD 5800x, 32 GB of high speed ram, and a new(ish) motherboard. This game should not be dropping under 60 FPS on the campaign map. What's so odd is that in battles it runs much better, but the campaign seems to have FPS issues. It's probably better to have smooth battles but still, something is clearly wrong. A lot of people are blaming the DRM, but this is the same DRM that was in Warhammer 2 so unless they changed it I am questioning the validity of that. So far I had the game hard crash on me only once. Also there are lots of mostly minor bugs, such as getting stuck in forced march even if you did not move, a slannesh research that breaks their entire faction mechanic, the auto resolve constantly saying your going to die when really your probably going to curb stomp the enemy, just to name a few. Besides that, the AI actually seems to be working mostly well which surprised me because it had a lot of problems in the early release. Though I did have ONE siege battle where the AI picked a random supply spot and decided to defend that and ONLY that while I took the actual victory point.

-The UI. RED ON RED, HOPE YOU LIKE RED CAUSE RED IS ALL WE GOT! Seriously, it's all red. Also it feels cluttered af on the campaign map. All the quest are piled up and there is constant crap popping up in my face. EVERY TIME I go into a siege the advisor is like ""DO YOU WANT A RUNDOWN OF HOW THIS WORKS!?"" and I can't even click the rundown to make it go away because it appears to be bugged and nothing happens. Also they removed a lot of the artwork and simplified things. 

-Public Order for chaos factions. Having full your corruption gives you a +10, any other corruption being at full expect undivided is -20. If a rift spawns in your land it'll give you like +30 corruption and reach 100 within 3-5 turns. This basically means if your playing a demon faction every time the rifts spawn you have to go on a frantic mad dash to close them in time before rebels appear.

-The rifts: They can spawn anywhere and spread corruption, ok that's fine in theory. It's only 1500 gold with a agent of a small battle with a army to get rid of them. BUT they also spawn armies and let enemies teleport using them, WITHOUT A NOTIFICATION. I normally got warned when a army came out of a rift when the game told me a settlement was besieged. Also as mentioned before, the corruption is WAY TOO HIGH. You'll have 100 corruption of one of the chaos gods within 3-5 turns on average.

-The Start Campaigns: The suggest starting campaign is Kislev or Chaos Undivided. What both these campaigns have in common is that you'll be at war on all fronts nearly constantly. The Ice Court starts with one city, at war with a faction that owns 3 settlements and a city, and two Norse factions. Undivided, I have no idea why but the entire planet just hates undivided. I understand your a demon prince that wants to conquer the planet, but there is a lot of that going around! The AI could pick a fight with Khorn or Nurgle, but instead REALLY LIKES to bully undivided. I understand these factions are the easiest to play in battle, but they can be nightmares on the campaign.

-Allies attacking Vassals: If you are planning on making vassals or playing slannesh. DO NOT DO MILITARY ALLIANCES. The dumbass ""allies"" will attack your vassals...for some reason. Undivided was getting along just fine with the Norscans until I vassal them, then suddenly they craved blood.

-Infinite respawning barbiarns: If you play Cathay you get hordes of kurgans to deal with nonstop, they can't die. They come back every time, you can't make peace with them as Cathay. Enough said.

OK. ONTO THE GOOD.

-Story: The main improvement I noticed right away was the game has a much better narrative. The advisor has a actual reason to align himself with each faction, the prologue explains who the undivided faction leader is, and the main antagonist actually has some cut scenes and build up.

-Factions: Each faction feels different both in battle and on campaign. The rosters are small, there is no DLC expect for the ogre's yet so don't expect the amount of units Warhammer 2 had with all it's DLC/FLC. There are actually very few reskinned units for the demon factions. Each demon faction get's a forsaken, a spawn, and a fury; besides that all the units among the demon factions are unique. The non-demon factions each felt unique also, none of them felt like the previous factions. Kislev was the most familar out of them but Kislevs strong emphasis on hybrid unit and bear Calvary that function better when allowed to stay in melee instead of cycle charging gave them their own flavor. 

-Campaign map: It looks really good, not much else to say. goes as far as Altdorf and a few of the northern dwarf factions and we get the whole of the chaos waste for the most part. A couple small area's like chaos dwarves appear to be missing but I am hopeful their arrive eventually.

-The Models: Keeping it short, all the new models are really good. The units are very well animated all around. Just stare at some nurglings for a bit if you have doubts. 

-The Gameplay: For the most part, everything is improved (when it functions). Legendary feels a lot more fun to play because the AI has some restraint, they'll still snowball like crazy if you let them but the early game is a lot less brutal. I didn't see the AI bum rushing with 3-4 stacks by turn 20. WHICH IS GOOD cause several factions start off at war with enemies that already have 3-4 settlements/cities.

-The Sounds: All the sound design felt great, from the VA, to the music and in game battle effects. The only sound I didn't like was that the lead belchers sounded a bit too quiet for what is supposed to be a cannon.

-More Dialogue: General speeches are not back properly but your generals will now say a few words at the start of battle and units will talk more in battle and even on the campaign map. One issue I do have is the lack of new dialogue for old factions and the lack of ""friendly"" dialogue for demons. My vassals still talk down to me in diplomacy screen. 

-The Map Graphics: The maps really good, not much else to say without spoiling them. Though I did think the Khorne maps made things a little hard to see sometimes. 

Ok, now onto sieges that I am still deciding on if they'll bad or good.

-Seiges/Settlements: So siege battle maps are a lot battle and settlements have proper maps now even when not walled. I like the new maps, I like the supplies, but I have a few issues. 
1. I do not like being able to build towers MID BATTLE. It means that destroying them with arty is kinda pointless beacuse in the time it takes to wreck it, they'll get enough supplies for another one. Towers should have to be pre-placed. I am ok with barricades being made mid battle because that's more believable and a lot less annoying. 
2. Some factions are just not good at sieges. Slannesh and Nurgle lack any decent siege equipment. Slannesh get's way too many chariots and calvary in their garrisons. You can overcome with these weaknesses with max tier units, but that is a steep price and long goal.","Gameplay Mechanics, Player Agency, Strategic Balance"

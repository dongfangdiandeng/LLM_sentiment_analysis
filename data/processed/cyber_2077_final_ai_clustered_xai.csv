"8/10

Pros:
- sometimes shocking graphics and details, and we're talking about an open city experience. I have a high-end PC and I've never had any problems
- overall style and artistic direction
- cool shooting and overall effects
- tons of side missions

Cons:
- What weighs the most in my vote, the primal plot never won me over and various endings decided in... I don't want to say too much...
- Very poor enemy AI: for example I can kill 10 soldiers 2 meters away with a silenced revolver but if I hack twice everyone knows where I am
- Very basic melee combat / driving experience
- Confusing UI, basic equipment management system","Visuals and Art, Gameplay Mechanics, Narrative"

"Despite the issues with bugs and glitches, I adore this game. The story is great and the side quests often surprised me with how detailed they were. When I could slip into a side quest and it felt like it was a main quest of its own with a few branching secondary quests, thats when I fall in love with a world's lore. The fact that Pondsmith does voice over for a radio station also makes me feel as if the Game master of this vast campaign is letting us in on the deeper sectrets of the world as he starts arranging the next part of the story. Its the small details like that that really make this one of my new favorite games. The game has tons of issues, from grindy crafting that takes too long to buggy vehicle physics that pull me out of this wonderfully immersive world. those are what some will feel like great let downs in this gem of a game. Those issues make this a diamond in the rough until CDPR fixes and improves those glaring problems.","Narrative Depth, Technical Stability, Immersion"

"Good point :
The game is beautiful, playable (even with bug), have multiple ends, a lot of clothes and weapons.

Bad point :

- The main story isn't good/interesting, you can finish it very quickly and (SPOIL OF THE END - DON'T READ) when you finish, you go back before the last mission. Fuck, i want to know what happen to V.


- If you don't do the very dangerous mission, the game is very easy (yes i'm in normal but still too easy).

- Most weapons, cyberware and lvl points are only usefull after the main story.

"10/28/23 Update:
Decided to try this game out again after phantom liberty came out due to a friends suggestion and i gotta say, WOW. What a complete difference from the mess that this game was when it first came out!

Ive beat the game again and played through the expansion, and my experience this time was much much better. In my original review, i complained about not needing the hacking all that much.. but in retro spec that was really up to me since this game allows so many different ways to be played. Wanna be a shoot and run? go for it. Hack everyone and everything? No problem. This time around, i played with the focus of hacking and i had a lot of fun with it. 

Story is great, game play is great. Im changing my review, and i'd recommend this game for sure. 


AMD Ryzen 5 3600
32 GB Ram
RTX 2060 Super

I played the game on Normal.

For 60 dollars, I do NOT recommend this game.
For 30 dollars, pick it up, but expect bugs.

With that said, I cant stop talking about this game to my friends. 

34 Hours in, and i've beat the game. From what i understand, there are multiple endings to this game, and I've seen one of them so far. Honestly, I'm not a fan of how my story ended, and thankfully when you beat the game... they allow you to load your last save before the ending so you can pick an alternative timeline. Other endings are unlocked by doing side missions.

Let me just say, when it comes to suggesting this game or not suggesting this game, its close. I had a lot of fun with this game. With that said, there are a number of bugs.. some game breaking. If you haven't already, you absolutely need to download gpu drivers. They fix a lot of visual bugs. 

[Visuals : 5/5] Visually, it looks fantastic. A large  open world with tons of unique buildings, stuctures, and scenery. That[ alone is in my opinion, the best part of the game. I had a lot of fun with photo mode, and just taking in the sights. I truly did feel like I was there.

[Story 4/5] The story comes in a close second. Fantastic story, believable characters, and i found myself having a few ""feels"" when certain events happen (your my boy jackie). However, i will say that at certain times.. i did feel a little lost in the story. Especially at the beginning. They dont tell you a whole lot, and they expect you to care about characters that obviously your guy would care about in real life,but as a player.. im left wondering ""wait, who is this again?"" 

Ever watch the move 8mm? Its a great movie. This game reminded me a lot of that movie, except for searching for a woman on a tape.. i'm trying to find someone to help me with the chip in my head. However, go to sex shop 1 to see so and so. then go to bar 2 to see so and so. Then go to club 1 to see so and so, then go to sex shop 2 to see so and so. You get the point. For a world as massive as this, i feel they repeated a lot of the places you went to was just another variation of the place you just left. Cool places, dont get me wrong, but i feel like they could of varied it a bit more. 

Gameplay [3/5] In this section, im going to cover most of the game. I felt the visuals and the story needed a seperate category, but everything else can be summorized under gameplay. Again, the game is fun. However, like everyones been saying.. there are a number of bugs. Some bugs i personally experienced...

1. Camera getting stuck
2. Weapons cant be drawn (restart didnt work, had to get to next cutscene to fix)
3. Falling through the map (had to restart)
4. Enemies glitch/clip through object
5. Unable to exit the vehicle (had to restart)
6. Bosses bugging out and freezing, making fights easy.
7. Unable to change camera views while driving
8. Gigs glitching out, unable to complete.

I had to restart the game a number of times while playing in order to get around game crashing bugs.  I cant remember the last time i payed 60 bucks for a game, and had this many issues. 

But lets forget about the bugs for a moment. Without spoiling the game, i'm going to touch on a few things here that others have stated. In no particular order...

1. Police AI does not exist.  If you kill a civilian or a cop, expect to die within a few second. Yes, I know this game isn't GTA, but something in the middle would of been great. Cant tell you how many times ive run people over by mistake trying to take a corner, just to have a crime reported and cops spawn right next to you to put a bullet into your dome. Try to drive away, and the cops become kobe, and lob grenades. Bottom line... if your not killing a gang member, or on a mission that specifically says to attack someone, expect to get attacked pretty quickly and die. For a dystopian world filled with crime, the cops respond very quickly. This is a huge immersive breaking issue in my opinion, and would bring me out of the game every single time it happened. 

2. Player clothing / stats is horrible. Hope you dont mind wearing a bra and a dress. For some reason, those 2 items might have better stats than what you currently have. I played as a male character, and at the end, i was wearing a hood, with a gas mask, a long trench coat, a pair of blue shorts, and a pair of dress shoes. Why? Cause they had the best stats. Thank god this game isn't third person, cause i must of looked insane. 

3. Hacking is a cool feature in the game. I would argue that most of the time its not needed though. However, because i didnt use the upgrade system much, there are probably a number of hacks i didnt use. However, i beat the game without hacking except for a handful of times, and even during those times, it was just to do something different.

Overall, the game just feels unfinished. I was not a hyped up fan boy, and i picked it up because it finally dropped and i said f it, lets give it a go. With that said, i wasnt expecting some amazing game like a lot of people were, but i can understand why people are frusterated. As of writing this right now, sony has pulled the game from the store due to the massive amount of bugs. After completing the game, i do want to go back and check out some of the other endings, but i estimate i have about another 5 - 10 hours of enjoyment from this game before i uninstall it (or at least forget about it).

Update :: I've since spent some more time playing side missions and im still enjoying the game. I will admit though, everytime i get to a point where im like, ""you know what.. this game isnt that bad, i should edit my review"" then BAM... gotta restart due to some weird shit. LOL.  When i see weird graphical stuff, i just say to myself ""ah, its just v's optics messing up""","Post-Launch Improvements, Gameplay Versatility, Narrative Quality"
"Editing this review for the time being. The game has gone through a lot of bugfixing now and finally feels fairly stable. The NPCs are still bland, but cars now see the enemy as a passable collision and drive around you. Cops spawn further away making it seem like they react to a crime rather than just teleporting to you. 

The game has its bright sides (namely story and graphics, especially if you play with RayTracing), but the downsides still don't justify full AAA price IMO. The AI is bland, the gameplay is just okay and the open world feels entirely lackluster. At some point during the game, you turn into an unstoppable powerhouse that one-hits every enemy. Harder difficulty merely increases damage output by enemy AI, they can now one-shot you. Not a fun way to balance fights. 

Speaking of balanced fights, f*ck the fist fight missions on anything above normal difficulty. The melee combat feels wonky and sluggish at best and unfair at worst. The enemy slides across the room as if magnetically drawn to you, he one-hits you, you need 100 hits in on him. Blocking and dashing doesn't guarantee damage reduction. 

There is no point in driving around except to get to a (albeit sometimes well designed) job contract. Empty streets, local vendors ignore you or say the same, uninspired line every NPC has in offer for you: 'Go away.' 'What a nice day!' 'What a lazy way to implement AI interaction!'.

Making choices throughout the story only has an impact on the mission that follows immediately afterwards. After said mission, the choice you made will now be forgotten by everyone. Street credit does not exist, not street gang member ever mentions your name, your reputation or any of that. 

All that being said, and I forgot a ton, the story still has great moments and lovable characters. The game just isn't worth full price at the moment. Get it for 20-30 bucks at most, if you can.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Balance, Consumer Value"
"This game has by far the most beautiful and immersive world in any game or piece of media i've ever seen. 
There will be plenty of other reviews talking about the gameplay and performance, but man the world, what a sight to behold.

The people walking by, the ads, music, graffiti, authorities speaking through PAs to the city and just breathtaking views of a massive corporate fortress everywhere you go. The political and actual setting of Cyberpunk 2077 is absolutely fascinating.

Seriously, I havent even fast travelled once yet, in fact most of the time I dont even drive. Simply walking through the city is an experience worthy of the price all on its own.","Immersive World, Atmospheric Setting, Exploration Value"
"So, this is definitely an interesting game for a number of reasons, most of them good. 

Overall: There is an immense amount of detail in this game, from the characters to every corner of the game world around you. I find myself getting lost in just walking around the city and enjoying the sights and sounds. There is a lot to do, especially as you progress through the game. It's almost like a cyberpunk gta in the best way possible.

Performance: For some reference performance wise, It's no secret that as of right now the game has a lot of bugs, but from my experience none of them are game breaking, more of them are the type that make you laugh, honestly. I currently play with a nvidia 1660 ti with a ryzen 5 3500, so no ultra settings for me, but It still runs very smoothly from my experience. The game has not crashed on me after 30 hours of play so far. Even on just high settings this game is visually stunning, a lot of that has to do with the theme and the source material. I highly recommend looking into the old rpg from 1988 that this world is based from for reference.

Gameplay: This is a very dialogue and story heavy game, yes there is a good amount of combat encounters, and the shooting mechanics feel very good and well thought out but don't expect to be getting into a gunfight every 10 minutes. Although when they do happen, boy does it feel good so it's worth it.

Verdict: Personally I absolutely have been enjoying this game and it was worth the 8ish years worth of development to wait. I can not say it's perfect, or that it will please you personally, but if you enjoy this type of theme or are just looking for a immense game world to immerse yourself in, this is a very good one. 

Side note: Like I said previously, at the moment it is pretty buggy, but not game breaking. Regardless, if that is something that would really bother you, I would wait for a few months for major updates.

The game is lacking in certain areas but its definitely still in the top list of my favorite single player games. 

I hope they add more customization to characters, vehicles, weapons and more immersive activities where you can actually interact with the world for example gambling, mini games, being able to eat/drink at food places and bars.

"It's just not that compelling for the asking price.

Dialogue is well written, but the plot itself is pretty dull so far, don't feel like any dialogue choices I'm making are having a perceptible impact on the game. The characters are likeable and distinct from one another, so that's good. The open-world aspect seems like set-dressing since very little of it seems to be meaningfully interactive. 

At least on hard difficulty, the combat is a clunky mess of damage sponges that don't pose much of a threat. It's reminding me a lot of Fallout 3 combat, and that's definitely not a good thing. There are options for stealth/quickhacking but they don't really feel necessary when shooting people in the face works extremely well.

So far gear is boring. It's a bizarre choice to have clothing be strictly-better on armour values. If you want to not turn into a puddle in combat you'll need to equip the 130 armour fedora and cargo shorts, sorry. The perks seem kind of cool until you realise they're interacting with a combat system that's baseline boring and has you up against relatively braindead AI. 

To top it off, the framerate is all over the place and the graphics presets don't seem to adjust the fact that performance is erratic despite GPU utilisation being inexplicably low. [Yes, I updated my drivers :-)] Sure, the game looks pretty good, but, it doesn't look good enough to explain whatsoever the insanely bad performance. Lots of visual bugs, but those are the least of your worries.","Consumer Value, Narrative, Gameplay Mechanics"

"Lemme tell ya choom, long as you got the eddies, you best not sleep on one of the most nova gaming experiences this half of the 21st century. Otherwise, 'd be a real gonk move on your part. NC's one of the most impactful game worlds I've ever encountered with some of the most preem storytelling and character development of both main and side characters in any open world RPG I've played. Level progression is smooth and hella engaging no matter what kind of merc you choose to be, opening up the door for future re-runs alongside different choices you'd want to make in the main story. DLC's also an incredible experience with great characters, offering the most unforgettable parts of the entire game from my view. Bottom line, this is one of CD Projekt Red’s finest gigs.

"Pre 2.1:

Alright, listen up, choombas! This game had all the hype, all the expectations, and let me tell you, it delivered in some ways, but fell short in others.

First off, Night City. This place is a damn masterpiece. The neon-soaked streets, the towering skyscrapers, the gritty back alleys - it's everything you'd expect from a cyberpunk world. The atmosphere is spot on, and it truly feels like you're living in a dystopian future.

Now, let's talk about the story. CD Projekt Red tried to weave an epic tale of rebellion and corporate greed, and they did a decent job. But there were moments where the pacing felt off, and some plot lines didn't get the attention they deserved. It's like they tried to cram too much into one game, and it suffered because of it.

Gameplay-wise, it's a mixed bag. The gunfights are intense, the hacking mechanics are solid, and the character customization is top-notch. But there were some bugs, glitches, and AI issues that took away from the overall experience. It's like trying to jack into the Net with a faulty interface - frustrating as hell.

Look, Cyberpunk 2077 had the potential to be a game-changer, a true legend in the gaming world. And while it falls short in some areas, it still manages to capture the essence of the cyberpunk genre. It's a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless.

So, if you're willing to overlook some rough edges and dive headfirst into Night City, give Cyberpunk 2077 a shot. Just remember, it's not perfect. Stay rebellious, chooms!

"Cyber Punk is an amazing game! At first it didn't grip me til I got more into the story and figured how to play the game. I know a lot of people rant about how broken the game is, but I didn't have many problems through my play through. Occasionally there would be funny glitches like Johnny Silverhand's cigarette would be floating in mid air while he's talking, dead people would have one leg up in the air, and at times the lips wouldn't sync up to the dialogue. There have been a few patches since I bought the game, and the game seems to run much smoother since. Not that I had any major problems in the beginning anyway. So this game is very story rich, and the action is great as well. It took some getting used to using the cyber attacks instead of  always the guns. Unlike in a lot of games where you have a bunch of throw away characters, this game has characters that you build a relationship with and tend to legit care about. You also can control how you talk to the characters, whether you want to be nice or a straight up jerk. Keep in mind, how you treat people will affect the ending. The game has really high replay value! You can choose between three life paths: Nomad, Street Punk, or Corpo. I started with Street Punk, and just put 34 hours into completing the 
 story, and I still didn't complete everything, so you won't have to worry about it being a short game. Trust me! I played the game using a RX 5700 XT,  Ryzen 7 3700x, 1440p monitor. I had settings set to high with a couple of things switched to medium, which kept my FPS between 50-60.  I know its not a Nvidia 2000 or 3000 series like they recommended, but the game looked amazing to me anyway. If you love story rich, FPS, RPG, immersive , action adventure, then you should get this game.","Narrative, Technical Stability, Gameplay"
"Awesome game.. awesome story.. thank god for quicksave though; there are currently numerous bugs in the game that will result in your character's very unexpected and frustrating demise. So, yeah the game's autosave/quicksave will end up being your best friend at times.

"This review will not mention any of the bugs or glitches that make this game unplayable in its current state. To me, the game simply is not fun. The combat is chunky at best, choices do not matter, and the story is mediocre in my point of view. I would describe this game as a mix between Fallout 4 and GTA, except in those games, you AT LEAST have a few choices that matter during your playthrough. It is clear to everyone by now that the game needed at least another year of development. It's asinine that people pay $60 for a game thats broken and unfinished, and its infuriating that we have to rely on the devs to fix these issues, months after the release date.

But really, After playing through the game, played EVERY single mission, I can say with 100% certainty that its not as buggy as you think it is.

Its a really good game.","Technical Stability, Consumer Value, Fan Appeal"
"I came to the game late, only picking it up a few weeks (a year after launch).  I had low expectations based on what I'd seen online about the game.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and side quests.  I thought the game's aesthetic was spot on for a Cyberpunk world.  I have only done one play through, but that was well worth the money. 

I did encounter a few bugs on PC, but nothing game breaking.  I had one crash to desktop, some stuck bars / text of prior conversations, and a few glitchy scanning issues.  Otherwise, I didn't notice any other major technical issues.

Combat is fun and diverse.  The ability to play as a netrunner, tech weapons wielder, stealth class, regular weapons, or melee class (or combinations of the above) was really fun.  A sneaky netrunner with a silenced pistol made for fun combat to me.

I did not really care for a lot of travelling, the vehicle system was a tad tedious for my tastes.  Otherwise a really good game, and provided around 50 hours of good quest content, with some follow-on time to grind experience to complete my build.","Narrative Quality, Technical Stability, Combat Variety"

In all seriousness its a great concept and while its not my fav game of 2020, I'll play through it. It kinda reminds me of elder scrolls in the way that even a super shitty elder scrolls game can be fun to mess around with. I was super excited for this game and I guess I just expected more polish in terms of PC customization and RP, it feels much more restrictive than advertised.

This game, in terms of substance, is brilliant, super vivid world with memorable characters. In time, I'm confident it will live up to the legacy of Witcher 3.

Before I say more, I take my time with RPGs like this. Meaning I spent the vast majority of my playtime doing side quests, and in this game that can help you a ton in the main quest line. 

Side quests are unfortunately bugged to hell and back. I currently have several side quests marked in my journal as unfinished despite me having completed all objectives. I have overlooked nothing, these quests are bugged. I cannot track them and I do not have any unfinished objectives. I am a spastic reloader playing a stealth netrunner. It seems reloading a save makes the current mission in progress less stable and is likely why I have so many of them bugged out.

One or two broken side quests would be fine, but four is too many. Game really feels like beta testing sometimes.

"Cyberpunk 2077, a vision of the future where greed corruption and hedonism reach an apex. You play as V, a merc of the city with a dream of being a legend of night city by either dying in a blaze of glory, or with a whimper. Its your choice.

Developed by CD Project Red Cyberpunk 2077 launched in a failed state, with massive technical issues and wasn't feature complete, Fast forward nearly 3 years and Cyberpunk 2077 has pulled 180! With multiple large patches fixing the majority of bugs, adding secrets, a gameplay overhaul, vehicle combat, and additional mission content. The transformation from launch to now is Night and Day.

Night City is truly an immersive experience, with a scale and density that I've never seen in any game. Then combine the visual splendor of night city with downright the best selection of radio and synth based scores I've ever had the pleasure of hearing in any game. And you've got a title that is not only immersive but truly captivating. That not even to mention the story, which might just be the crown on top Cyberpunks experience.

Lets touch on that for a brief period. Before release we were promised a certain type of ""web of branching mission paths"" based on choices, and at release that's what a large portion of the player base was expecting. We did not receive this experience, instead we got a more straight forward story experience with about 7 different endings base of a final choice. Phantom Liberty does rectify this with a point where you get completely new content depending on choices you make, and I truly think that the base game would've benefited from a system like this. However the story that is currently in the game is fantastic and leaves a decent amount of player choice. Especially how this story concludes based of relationships made while completing the main and side content. 

Overall Cyberpunk is in my top 5 games of all time. The setting, story, music, gameplay all fit my tastes, And I am very happy that with the final updates coming in, Cyberpunk is now in a place past where I visioned it on release. That not to mention Phantom Liberty, which might just be my new favorite DLC CD Project Red has made. 10/10 Breathtaking.

Just for better context, here's my setup:

[list]
 [*]AMD Ryzen 3 2200G
 [*]Asus Prime A320m-K/BR
 [*]16 GBs of RAM over two 8 GB sticks
 [*]NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super
[/list]

Notes on performance through the 60 hours I played:

It ran very stable on Ultra(without Ray Tracing) throughout most of the time, though when in the city itself your frames may drop a little. In the Badlands, it usually ran at 60 frames. Some minor bugs here and there, particurly texture pop in. However, two things of note and how to get rid of them.

[olist]
 [*]The game sometimes would take forever to save, as in, the next sections would not load due to the game trying to save and not managing to do it. To fix that, I went on the settings of the game itself and disable cloud saves. That fixed and it never happened again.
[*]When I was doing something else with my computer, the game ran notably worse, so if you see some drop in perfomance, you might want to pause downloads and other things to focus only the game. 
[/olist]

My thoughts on the game itself are: if it had came out on a stable state at launch, it would very easily run for Game of the Year. So if you think your rig is good enough, go ahead and have fun, choom.","Technical Stability, Performance, Hardware Compatibility"

There's this really strange feeling I have playing it where I swear I feel like i'm playing Skyrim only in the future.  Maybe It's Braindead Jackie then endlessly gets in the way. Maybe it's the glitches(that began happening in the first 5 mins of my experience)  Maybe it's the random npc's that, if you follow one of them, will just all of the sudden disapear in the middle of the street.  Like actually just pop out.  That's all Skyrim stuff.
Is it beautiful?  Yeah.  It is.  Nothing limit pushing or groundbreaking or unique.  It's new.  Never saw a big ass city like this before.  That's cool.  But I never saw big ass mountains before Skyrim either and I wouldn't have said that it was groundbreaking either.  
I don't know what I expected.  So much damn hype and so much damn expectation that I placed on it.
At the end of the day, it's a good game.  I'm enjoying it.  I'll p lay thru the main story and see where I'm at when it's over.  Honestly though, one play thru and I think i'll be ready for something else.

I highly recommended it if you are a fan of the genre. I do wish CD project had taken its time and delivered a finish product and avoid the bad rep and drama.  

Cyberpunk does feel like a real world.  The architecture and level design is amazing.  The buildings make sense unlike most video games. Night City feels like a real city with all sorts of stores, neighborhoods and peoples. The story lines are interesting and engaging.  The characters are complex. 

My only complains are that many talents in the talent tree feel underpowered. Also, driving a car is rather annoying and the map doesn't seem to mark vendors. 

If you are a fan of the Cyberpunk genre. This game is a must.

Don't bother because it is still the same trash bugfest with garbage AI, garbage driving, hundreds of ways a quest can be bricked and thousands of instances you need to reload a save to go back before a bug fucks you over. I'll probably enjoy it the same way I did before but this time with a better character builder.

I watched some reviews and one thing they had in common was ""the bugs are squashed"" - complete BS.

Besides, they said in the hype-up for Cyberpunk back in 2017-2020 that all DLC would not only be free, but there would be multiple. If you're one of those saying ""DLC and expansions are not the same thing"", just piss off.

"TL:DR - It's a great game. Get off the hypetrain and you won't get cucked again by a marketing department in the future.

After seeing the first announcement trailer and nearly wetting my pants at the idea of a futuristic witcher (futuritcher... whuture...) I immediately felt that familiar sting in my memory. The memory of the last hype train I rode to the end and was burned hot by an entirely good game because it hadn't lived up to the unattainable perfect game in my imagination. Never again was I going to pre-order. Never again was I going to put a game on a pedestal. I watched the gameplay trailers every month or so in the dry months but that was it. I had no expectations except more Witcher 3 and in the future. And it delivers.

Playing the game and then reading reviews referencing the hype-train content I can see that they really did slim down on their promises of something that was INSANE in it's scope that they definitely could have delivered with more time.

That said, going into it blind meant that it was the game I was expecting and I'm not even 20% of the way through and enjoying every second.","Hype Expectations, Marketing Critique, Delivery Satisfaction"

"main story good, ""open world"" features bad

braindance tapes useless aside from main story ones, non-functional clubs/food vendors, pedestrians do nothing except tell you to fuck off or miraculously get hit by your car when you're 3 feet away from them, ai cars are on rails, car physics are done with low quality raycasting so there's no real suspension or anything, ""police chases"" entail about 3 ai cops spawning 5 feet IN FRONT of you because there's no car ai, not to mention how unplayable this game is without dlss at 1440p. the game also somehow manages to 100% max out my i7-6700k while in the city, with its impressive ai constantly telling me to fuck off. my cpu is relatively old, but the fact that the cars are literally on rails and the pedestrians have no real coding, the performance makes zero sense. also 75% of the times that i launched the game, the performance decreased by about 40% after a few hours, 95-100 fps at 1440p down to 50 fps for literally no reason. ram usage is normal, same with cpu, game just slowly runs worse over time. there were only 2 times that i had truly game breaking bugs where i had to restart: early in the game jackie got locked behind a door so i couldn't talk to him to continue, and in the last missions i offed multiple guards and 2 didn't count as dead, even though they were laying on the ground and lootable, so i had to restart the entire mission to continue. outside of those, i had a few cutscenes with missing dialogue, jackie walked straight through a wall, and one t-pose npc in freeroam. 

while this game has a lot of shit wrong with it, it's still a great game. the hype is what's really killing it, because the fact that it was hyped so hard amplifies how bad some of the bugs are. it should honestly be labeled early access because it's pretty obvious that it is. cut/unfinished content and awful optimization, i have no idea how anyone with a non-rtx card could even run this game since they don't have dlss. but if you have a very beefy pc, this game is worth it, otherwise just wait for a lot more optimization patches.","Narrative, Open World Gameplay, Technical Performance"

"""Eh""

Before I start my tirade, I must say the overall visuals are fantastic. I've dreamed of being able to wander around a virtual city like this since I was a kid and, many years later, I'm now able to do it. Bugs? Sure. I've seen much worse. I won't comment on those; I haven't had many issues.

I was originally compelled to get on the hype train in large part because of the genre and The Witcher 3. I didn't realize that a lacking main story would be a huge problem, though. Here, the setup is you're some merc in a dystopia that gets the short end of the stick in a heist. The rest of it is about you trying to get this chip/shard out of your head that's going to kill you no matter what.

The side quests/""jobs"" are great since it expands on something I really liked in The Witcher 3. However, after a while it starts to feel repetitive like Metal Gear Solid 5: just taking out one outpost after another. Shoot some more baddies, and move on. Some of the side jobs have a bit of substory to them but there aren't as many of them as I'd hope. Couple that with the main story of ""hey, by the way, you're still dying"" - it doesn't feel very satisfying to me.

I think the biggest killer for me - and this is me personally - is that it feels more a commentary on today's world than an escape. Megacorps as portrayed in the game don't exist, but they aren't entirely fiction either (Amazon, for instance, makes more money off its cloud services than it does selling goods; Google and Facebook have aggressively bought up other companies unrelated to their core product solely for the purpose of building personal profiles to market towards). While it's true that, this narrative exists in an entirely different reality than the one we live in, I think this past year and the years to come have and will start to resemble this paradigm of unrest, violence, and environmental disaster.","Visual Quality, Technical Stability, Narrative"

[b] THE BREAKDOWN (short N sweet) [/b] :
[b] -Graphics [/b] 
[b] -Audio [/b] 
[b] -Story [/b] 
[b] -Gameplay [/b] 
[b] -Bugs/Issues [/b] 


1) The graphics:  Visually this game is stunning, like you can literally just walk around Night City in awe of the beauty and size of it.  It feels massive and the atmosphere of the city is enticing and fun, like you want to be apart of it.  Truly, Night City is immersive and keeps your attention, it did mine.  Character models are pretty good, not hyper realistic 4k models, but they compliment the aesthetic and art style the city and/or game reflects.  Weapons look great, definitely better than the character models.  The in game cinematics are amazing, you can tell the Matrix is a huge influence on the game and they captured the vibe of it well.  Can't really say enough about the visuals in this game, definitely a highlight.
10/10

2) Audio:  The audio is are good, can't really complain about this too much.  Guns sound punchy, the samurai swords sound great, especially with the animation you get when you first pull them out.  Most of the sound design works for this game, the hacking noises, breaking bottles, and etc; all sound just fine.  When you zoom in, you'll notice they've drowned out outside noises and if you zoom in on a conversation it'll have this ting like your listening in from a wiretap.  A nice small detail.  It's really the music on the radio stations that didn't do it for me, mind you they aren't all bad, Edgerunners theme song is in there some where, but overall its nothing special.  Finally, the dialogue can be heard easily, haven't had to really listen in on a conversation.  Overall, I thought the sound design was pretty good.     
9/10

3) Story: The story is actually really good, something that I thought people really didn't touch much on from release and further YT reviews I've seen.  They get you to care about these characters in the game and your choices have consequences that affect you later.  Nothing groundbreaking about those statements by themselves, but its how its executed that made me enjoy it so much.  I maybe biased here, because the whole dystopian / cyberpunk future is really cool to me and I loved how they created this world and story for it.  Keanu did a great job I thought, although I wasn't crazy about Johnny Silverhands.  In lieu of spoiling things, I'll just say from gaming, this is one of the few stories that I reflected on and thought about.  It made me care about a fake world and pixels, which anytime art does that I think speaks volumes about it.  
10/10

4) Gameplay:  This is a big one, there's a lot to unpack in the gameplay, as the scope of it is ridiculous.  There is sooo much you can do in this game, there's the gunplay, the blades, special weapons like the mantis blades or monowire that give you so many play styles and ways to approach a given situation.  Gunplay is pretty standard in terms of modern gaming and isn't the best, but isn't terrible either.  There's the tech and hacking abilities you can deploy, which adds another level of dimension to the game.  Then there is the RPG aspect where you have perks you can add to your character building up your gun skills or hacking skills, you can craft items, change your clothes/style, and basically modify your character as you see fit.  Continuing on the builds there's cyberware which effectively give you superhuman abilities.  You can slow down time, hack everything, or doom slayer your way to victory.  It's got to be one of the most ambitious game's ever made for the sheer amount of things you can do and how you can do them.  
10/10

5) bugs/issues: I'm real late to this party of cyberpunk 2077, so I didn't (personally) see how buggy the game was at launch.  However, I am playing on a PC with a 1080 GTX and for the most part this game runs well.  I've mainly had lighting or flickering with lighting occasionally on this game.  Just restarting the game seems to fix it, but it is annoying and happens enough.  I've only see one T pose and a character sliding on the ground as opposed to walking.  The only weird bug that I have seen was in the prologue, I couldn't bring my weapons out for some reason and had to revert to a older save to fix this.  Only happened once, but ya.  Technical bugs were fairly minor playing on PC, but they do appear.  Lighting/flickering being the biggest issue for me; however, I'm sure everyone experiences this differently and I totally understand how last gen console players would basically be SOL playing this game. 

Now, I'm not sure if this should be in issues or gameplay, but I'll keep them separate for the review, the work around wasn't tied to the real gameplay.  Aiming, aiming is atrocious, I guess they are expecting you to be on KBM, but if you have a controller then pay attention.  You can get the aiming to be manageable through changing the settings in the game.  There are videos and guides on how so just Google them to find out and adjust to your comfort, it makes a huge difference.  Second issue is driving and holy shit, is it rough.  I can't imagine it was worse at launch, but prayers to the players that experienced that.  Like aiming, you can improve driving in the settings menu, but this doesn't work nearly as good as it does for aiming.  Honestly running and fast traveling seem to be a better option than driving, for the most part.  I'm not sure why its so bad, but it really is. For reference, I find driving in GTA: SA more intuitive and more functional than cyberpunk. This is by far, the worst aspect of cyberpunk 2077.  
5/10

**I've added mods into the game and some were for driving, this is necessary to do if you want to play a great game vs a decent game.  These are needed and also what I based my final score around.**

Final score (normalized): 8.8/10 
CP 2077 really is a great game (thanks to the mod community) and with sooo much potential.  After playing it, I see why development was like 9 years or whatever.  Frankly, it still needed time in the over at that too.  It does a lot of things well/pretty well and with the amount of freedom and scope it gives, its truly impressive from a technical standpoint that they got all this in the same game.  Easily one of the better games I've played in recent years, all things considered.  Its the bugs, settings, and driving mainly that hurts this game for me.  The bugs hopefully get worked out over the various patches (as I'm sure as been happening).  Fingers crossed that the driving mechanics get improved too.  Barring those problems, this would be a masterpiece and one to remember, one of the few single player games that offer real replay-ability to it as well.","Graphics, Story, Gameplay"
Patient gamers stay winning,Consumer Value
Pretty FUN,Fun Factor
"I honestly feel bad for the people mindlessly shitting on this game.
It's such a shame how the gaming community has progressed to be this toxic.
I've never been more engaged in a game than I have been these last 65 hours. I care about my character. I care about the characters around me. I care about the game's world.
There's just so much to love here. You could spend thousands of hours exploring every nook and cranny of Night City. Finding every choice, every route, every character build, and it would feel immensely satisfying.
I honestly couldn't recommend a game more.

Visuals
The game is (for lack of a better word) breathtaking. Honestly breathtaking.
I'm playing the game at mid settings and I couldn't be happier with the way it looks (and that's without ray-tracing). The wet roads of Night City provide and excellent canvas for the neon lights of signs and billboards to reflect. I could stop and look at this game for a very long time. The way light cascades around a location feels intoxicating. The shadows can be a little grainy at some points but it's not really an issue.
9.5/10

Level Design
Night City is packed. It's the densest game world I've ever seen. Everything is so detailed and meticulously thought through and (as previously stated) it's fucking gorgeous. Every district feels unique and every wrong alley turn could lead me to a possible crime scene or hidden market. Even the cultures present in Night City feel expertly realised.
10/10

Story
This is an important one. Stories have always been very important to me in terms of video games. This one has been no different. I haven't yet completed the game, but I can say without a doubt that I'm engaged as hell. It's a little slow near the beginning but once you get into the swing of things, it clicks.
Even the side quests are interesting. Unique as well. I'd probably say this game has the best side content I've seen in an open world. Some of the concepts for these quests are ridiculously insane and they're all the better for it.
8.5/10

Characters
They're real people. I've grown attached to them (I've cried for them). They are real people. I feel like I could practically touch them. This game has astounding levels of characterisation with fucking spot on voice acting. The writers knew what they were doing. They know how people's minds work.
There's so many characters to love, so many to hate. Most of all, I remember their names. Coming from someone that struggles to remember names in real life, I remember these people. They're memorable. I couldn't of asked for more in this category.
10/10

Gameplay
I feel like there's many ways to play this game. There's so many features and things to do. It can feel overwhelming, but you should just choose something. Go about it a step at a time.

Driving: Driving around Night City in the cars you have is fun. It's an amazing way to see the city and you get to listen to great music as you do so. It does feel a little slippery however. It depends on the vehicle, but turning at full speeds can send you going out of control (I've heard people call it boat-like which describes it pretty well). It's something you need to get used to. Bikes however, work great. I really love the attention to detail in how different cars control differently. This difference is even extended to wet weather or rough terrain. Each car is specially tailored to work a certain way on each environment. Despite sometimes losing control, it's never a big deal as your car always comes back fixed with no price (unless you blow it up which costs a small sum). 7/10

Shooting: I've heard some say the shooting mechanics feel clunky. Personally, I've not felt this issue as I've never been one for first person shooters. The shooting seems perfectly serviceable for me. The amount of weapons you can find is insane and there's light customisation involving scopes, muzzles, and mods that increase specific attributes. All weapons (and clothes, mods, etc) are in a tiered system with white, green, blue, purple, and gold indicating their rarity. I've had no trouble with these systems. 7.5/10

UI: The UI in this game is also pretty serviceable. It looks great, fits its purpose well, and is easy to navigate. There are a few quality of life improvements I'd like to see, such as being able to move a group of something with a singular key. Aside from small things like that, it's pretty good. 8/10

Dialogue: This is a big thing for me. I've never liked voiced protagonists in RPGs, but this game, has probably fixed my issues with them. Unlike in Fallout 4 where dialogue feels stilted (you choose an option, speak, they respond for a bit, you choose an option, etc) this game feels my character is having an actual conversation. You choose an option, and your character plus the person you're speaking to have an actual conversation (with your character sticking to the option you chose). This allows the main character to feel like their own person. You guide the basis of what he/she says but he says it in his own way. This is the best way I've ever seen a voiced protagonist work.
In terms of dialogue choices, there's no bullshit - no illusion of choice. The game tells you by the colour of dialogue whether what you've asked will move the conversation forward or whether its ""filler"". Blue text asks a question or adds context, and Yellow text continues the story in different directions and you can't go back to blue options. You can play the whole game without choosing a blue option, but it adds in lore and characterisation.
There's also dialogue checks in a similar vain to Fallout 3/Fallout: NV/Outer Worlds. These are based on your perk points which allows them to factor them into your character's dialect. It even has specific options for your chosen life path. This works wonders to make each play through unique.
Also, the game isn't limiting on how dialogue occurs. It's very free form. For example, you can walk around an area while speaking to an NPC as long as you don't move to far away. You can even speak to multiple characters at once, telling you which text will be said to which NPC.
Dialogue is one of my favourite parts of this game. 10/10

Issues:
There's no denying that this game has issues. It's pretty buggy at the moment with me encountering a minor bug every 20 mins, but it's constantly getting better. However, so far, I've only encountered one game breaking bug that was easily fixed and I haven't crashed once. Eventually, this won't be an issue at all.
Acceptable performance can be difficult to achieve according to your standards. (I'm playing on a GTX 1070 with an I9-9900k and I'm getting around 45 frames at mid settings and 1440p which I'm very happy with).
There's also some A.I issues. Traffic and pedestrians will get stuck if you place something in the way of their pathing, pedestrians will disappear if opening menus, roads sometimes seem empty etc.
My biggest issue is the police system. If you commit a crime in-game, there's no police chase. The NCPD will teleport behind you dealing devastating amounts of damage. If you drive away, after a few blocks, they'll forget about it. It's best just not to not deal with this feature. Besides, it's a small optional component of the game that you could completely overlook (and that's my main issue).
There are also some features that I wished the game had such as house buying, house customisation, and mid-game appearance editing, and car customisation, but it's not too much of a problem. Besides, I'm pretty sure the majority of that will be added as free DLC later down the line.

Overall, I've had such an incredible experience with this game. I seriously haven't felt this strongly about a title for a very long time. It saddens me to see people taking the few problems this game has and blowing them out of proportion. Trust me when I say this, this game is fucking incredible.
Go play it!

"I bought the game when it initially released. The game back then did have a lot of issues, mainly in the technical department. Back then, I saw that it also had a lot of potential. The writing and style of the game were great. The gameplay itself, though not perfect, was enjoyable.

Now, the game has achieved the status of one of my most liked games ever. A game, which I'll know I'll be replaying often in the coming future. The patches and updates have reduced the technical issues nearly completely (or at least to a state where I don't experience any of them). But what I did not expect, was that they reworked various parts of the gameplay to fully improve how the game played. A point which I initially did not deem necessary, though something which is very welcome, and gives way more variety in how the game is played.

On top of that, they released the Phantom Liberty DLC, which brings an entirely new type of story within the base game, without losing what I thought made the game great.

In conclusion, this game is one of the success stories, of a game that was flawed, yet had great potential underneath, that rose from its ashes to form something truly magnificent. If the game did not have great writing, an amazing style and excellent world building, we would have never gotten here, so I'm glad I was able to experience the transformation this game has made.","Technical Stability, Narrative Quality, Gameplay Improvements"
"1300 hours, 98% completion, just missing the APB achievement. How do I feel about my many hours in night city?
I started with my first run, as Male Corpo V many many moons ago and I started with 1.6. The edgerunners trailer got me interested and the edgerunners in game brain dance item/trailer forever won me a cyberpunk fan for life. 

I played and finished my first run, Corpo male V around November 2022. WOW what an experience going through the first time through night city. HUGE, vast and many many things to do. NCPD scanner, side quests, gigs, main quests etc etc. Lots of gear, ammo, weapons, clothing, cyberware and many many other lootable goodies. I was so amazed so many ridiculous moments, the views of the city are nothing short of breath taking. I can't believe I waited this long to play this game. BUT I'm more than please that I did. Because of the known issues at launch, good things come to those who wait.

Didn't start my 2nd run as Nomad Male V, till June 2023. YEAH, sorry I was playing others games during that time, lots of metal gear solid 5 The Phantom Pain and resident evil 2 remake on ps5. BUT that being said, I returned back to night city and half way through my 2nd run, we went from 1.6 to 2.0. 

Around October of 2023, when I updated to 2.0. WOW ok, what a HUGE difference, coming from 1.6 and now we're on 2.0 version. The game was overhauled completely. Can't compare 1.6 to 2.0 because the changes to perk tree system and re balance of the law watned/police system has made this game EVEN MORE worth the experience to night city. I spent many many many hours trying different builds, BECAUSE all my perk points were reset after the update. Did I want to go shinobi? Solo, enigineer, headhunter etc etc etc. And So began the HARD and long process of fine tunning my 2nd run, which was Nomad Male V.

After many hours of building v to my liking, finished my 2nd run as Nomad Male V on Valentines day, February 2024. Yeah, I wanted to make sure V, was ready for the new 2.0 updated game. I'm very happy how the re ovehauled perk tree/point system allowed us, to try and remove the point and try something else if it didn't fit our play style. WOW, finishing the game with 2nd time around, with the 2.0 update, in contrast when I completed the game 1st time through on 1.6, felt like a different game, especially the hacking. Only a handful of the hacks were untraceable, I had to adjust my stealth/hacking play style. BUT all those many hours fine tuning V, was more than worth it. Which leads us to my 3rd run, as female, Streetkid V. 

Began not too long after finished my 2nd run as male nomad v, I started March 2024 in my final run of the main game, as street kid female v. I already knew what build I wanted to go far, hacker/stealth build. Using hacking, silenced weapons and katana. Finally finished July 2024 on my 3rd run. WOW, what an amazing expereince. The entire game 2.0 update. Because my 2nd run with nomad male v, was half 1.6 and the other half 2.0. Thank you CDPR, what an amazing game. YES it was terrible at launch, but you gave us an experience, that will forever talk, as one of the best games ever in history. You just connect V, connect with all the characters in night city both GOOD and BAD haha. 1300 hours on record, WORTH every single second, every single minute and every single hour. 

Wake Up the F*ck up Samurai, we got a game to play.

"🚀 [i]Review contains main game and DLC spoilers, continue reading on your own risk[/i]

“The Tower” ending hit me hard. I get attached to my own created characters and ones with a strong story and deeply written personality (for example, Daud from Dishonored). 

I remember plain as day death of Jackie and V, covered in blood, looking in the mirror. 
I remember Victor getting emotional and screaming at V that this can’t go like that anymore, he is afraid to see one day V walking down the street… but not V anymore. I remember Misty taking V to the roof to make a choice, telling that right here Jakie made a decision to become famous in Night City. I remember V’s words “I can’t believe it. Everything. All we did - it was pointless” when Alt stunned her with words that death is irreversible.    

This ending was unexpected due to the amount of cruelty. I could never even predict how things will turn out for V (I have seen all endings). It was “obvious” she would die anyway, but still had the choice to spend last days in a preferable way. 

NUSA operation ending is soaked with despair. Once you run Night City - the other moment not able to defend yourself from one thug. Reed’s words “Your body… it ain’t goin’ back to what it was. And NC’s a city where you just won’t manage. Not anymore” were the last nail in the coffin. World moved on. In reality we face the same - the world keeps going and never stops to wait for us. 

Honestly disliked the plot of Phantom Liberty, the amount of manipulation breaks all records. Fearless merc gets treated worse than a dog and okay with it. There was a goal to get treatment and fight for life, but there were so many red flags. When I was left with two options - “Betray Reed” or “Betray Songbird” I couldn’t make a choice. Both didn't inspire sympathy. 

Dogtown by itself is not memorable as a city at all. Ruins, cars, thugs. I “enjoyed” sharp bright white light in a face that I didn’t experience in the main game. Come on, as I have seen - issue is not one-time, it happens frequently to many players. 

[b]Also lets talk more about game condition in late 2023: [/b]
Last NCPD ambush doesn’t spawn near stadium that blocks from achievement
Last gig in NC requires to be failed because needed car doesn’t spawn or spawns underground that also blocks from achievement
I have seen that they fixed gig in the last patch, but… it’s been there for years. Imagine having last to obtain achievement back in the days, waiting for a fix and when you are done with waiting - here is the fix that is not desirable anymore. 

But, anyway, thanks for another type of bug where I got a lot of achievements that I didn’t complete. Seems like a present for patience. 

[b]Conclusion: [/b]
I would strongly recommend playing the main game for the story. Dialogs, music, actors performance - that is needed to be heard and seen. DLC could be much better, like in Witcher 3 (that I enjoyed with all my heart being non-fan of the Witcher world). 

Thank you for emotions and unique memories, CD Project.

"My first play through was when this game released, and even though it came with bugs and glitches, it ran smoother than it does today after patch 1.31 - I have no clue as to what has been done by the devs, but the game doesn't feel as smooth any more.

If you are a gamer thinking of playing CyberPunk 2077 for the first time, I highly recommend you start with NOMAD. Best story option by a mile.

Warning: you will get attached to some of the main characters, and you will get your heart broken. Excellent character (NPC) writing, sadly not enough of it. This game does leave you begging for more and a feeling of 'something unfinished'. There are characters who you do not want to leave, but I've said enough already.

Forget the hype, the trash talking and the spoiler videos on YouTube, just go into it, immerse yourself and enjoy the whole experience.

EDIT - update: It's now patch 1.5, and to be honest, I find it disappointing with what has and hasn't been done. The game, in parts, now feels sloppy. Yes, CDPR have added some things, over looked others (Police AI, still no Police car chases - to name but one). 

In some respects, animation-wise, it looks as if they've let their interns loose on the game, and after playing hours in GTA V, I come back to Cyberpunk 2077 and see how massively it still falls short of what was promised, what it has the potential to be and what it should be. The rag doll physics are shameful, funny at times, but not for the positive.

I just wish Steam had a 'neutral' tag option for rating games, as that's what I'd give Cyberpunk 2077 now. But as it stands, it has to be a thumbs up just for that reason.

As of update 2.2 (2025) I still can't understand why CDPR devs have vehicle speed displayed in MPH, when every other aspect is in metres and kilometres - and for sure, the speed vehicles travel DO NOT match the MPH shown on the speedo, it should be in KPH without a doubt.

If you're not chomping at the bit to play this game, I would suggest hanging back, wait for price drops, better updates (if they ever happen) and take reviews on YouTube with a pinch of salt in the main.","Technical Stability, Narrative Quality, Character Development"

Update - The patch fixing a lot of the issues in my below review was finally released recently. So after about 3 years of further development, they have finally reached what I would consider a polished product. If you haven't played this game yet, I definitely encourage you to play now! 

--- old post
TLDR; Lazy GTA reskin with cybernetics. 

Not sure it was worth the full price. This release version is barely Beta quality with a number of bugs and poor UI issues. Would not recommend to a friend until they've fixed and improved on a lot of issues. Missing keybinds that you can't change, changing or removing a keybind doesn't always work as pressing the key or button still results in the action being performed even if it is bound to something else. Attachments/mods don't tell you what they work with, so you could buy a sight for your pistol and not be able to use it on your pistol but there is nothing in the tooltips or UI that warns you of that before you spend your monnies. Maybe a 30 or 90 day patch will earn a revisit to see if the game is worth playing. This is not the quality that I'd expect from this developer.

"This is a bad game. I bought this post patches, so it's mostly been stable. Still get t-poses and some other weird things, but Cyberpunk 2077, after playing, it's clear was never going to be a good game.

It gives off a vibe like Deus Ex Human Revolution meets Skyrim, l but I cannot advise enough not to buy this. Do not give anyone any money for this.

The intro is you're ushered through cutscenes that show you becomes a netrunner instead of actually letting you do this yourself. A game so bored of itself it find it necessary to try to skip ahead to get to the ""good part"" except jokes on you there is no good part of this game.

The vehicles should have been removed. The controls are clunky and the handling is awful. You would think that anyone who made a video game on PC would have a driving mode with the mouse where your mouse input mimics analog stick input from a controller and you can steer by moving your mouse. You would be wrong. This super-intuitive driving control scheme on PC does not exist in Cyberpunk 2077. Also, in a cybercity in the distant year 2077 apparently I can't do what I can do in 2021; tell my car to drive somewhere for me so I don't have to bother. They don't have Autopilot in 2077? What year did all the Tesla and Waymo cars die out? Hello? CDPR? Is anyone there? Why is your driving so bad in your open world driving game? What's good as new? Who's talking? *Pets Horeshoe Crab*

Combat is an afterthought-- Or at least I hope it is! A chaotic mess with poor gunplay, awful melee combat, and some kind of hacking thing? It's boring, unsatisfying, but the important part is, it's not fun. None of this game is fun. Some games have crouch as a setting, regarding if you want it to be hold or toggle. Some games have both keybinds if you want to use them. Cyberpunk 2077 (whose name is obnoxious to type, please name your game something else next time assuming you don't go out of business) has both keybinds, but the tutorial specifically uses the toggle one because they hate you. I use crouch hold, like a normal human being, and I spend most of the tutorial holding down crouch toggle wondering why it wasn't responding. Gun combat sure exists! But it has no depth at all beyond that. Melee I actually thought would be better coming from the Witcher lineage but it is even worse than the gunplay. Def don't specialize in melee, but the tutorial for that was not good. You have to hold down RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to charge a melee attack, and so I would hold it down and wait for some kind of visual cue to tell me it's finished charging. But there isn't one. There is no way to tell. The arm placement is different, but charge to me indicated like, it takes time to do? But charged 'heavy' melee attacks charge almost instantly to the point where if you're not tapping RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON constantly, probably you're doing charged attacks. It's so gross how they don't understand or implement any kind of basic video game conventions in this game.

The actual cyberpunk parts of Cyberpunk 2077 are stupid and boring. A lot of the pistol skills for example are just ""do more crit damage when you crit someone."" It the ""just get all; head shots bro"" skill tree. Wow that's so imaginative. In the far flung year of 2077 did you know you can kill people by aiming for their heads? The rest of the skill trees repeat this ad nauseam. There's no really cool cyber tech in this a la Human Revolution, it's... just stupid treadmill crap. It's the kind of game where enemies remain at a fixed level advantage above you no matter what you upgrade. It's just, ""Hey you like strength right? Well you should upgrade your strength so you can keep it hovering just below the AI's strength level.

Like many of these games, the developers decided stealth is the correct answer so you know, just play into stealth and don't do any other kinds of builds. The city itself is poorly designed so much as to be hostile to the player, which, why would you even do that?

The UX/UI is the worst part of the game. The PC controls are just absolutely terrible. Most keys toggle menus, right? Like M opens your map, and then press M to close it again real quick. But M doesn't close an open map. It does something else after the map is open, and ESC closes the map... or C? Or Q? I don't remember, but you can probably close it. Game designers have spend many years perfecting dialog interactions with NPCs. CDPR like, threw that out to do it wrong on purpose? So... when you interact with a computer terminal or machine, your crosshair becomes the cursor when you're close enough to that interface. When you speak to a person though, virtual dialog options come up in the air in front of them, but you cannot use your cursor, you have to use your mouse wheel and then awkwardly press F while probably your fingers are on WASD? It also mostly doesn't put you into dialog mode like Skyrim does, so you can still move around, but you have to stay still in front of the people you're talking to in order to talk to them anyway so I don't understand the point. The WASD keys can't be used to pick dialog options, nor is it even a dialog wheel like Mass Effect. It's a different system I guess just to be poor? To be a bad dialog system? Why did you do this? Interactions with things is poor. In your inventory trying to equip things had me constantly dropping things on the ground because you can't click on something to equip it, it's like clicking drops it? But if you hover an item and press F you can replace the item you're wearing in that slot. You can click a slot to see items from that slot to equip, but then there's no way to back out of that menu once you do? I don't completely remember how inventory works because it's the worst and makes no sense based on the convention other PC games have set up over the years. The game is full of stupid and frustrating inconsistencies like this. Most vending machines for example you can buy things from by using F. There is a machine you can sell junk to and this machine only operates by you pressing... R? What? Why?

I'll give you one my best example of how apparently no one at CDPR understand what video games are or how to make them. So you know elevators? You know how an elevator works by coming when it's called, and then you press a floor, and the elevator goes there and the door opens when you reach the requested floor(s)? Like the door opening signals it's reached its destination? In Cyberpunk, a futuristic city in 2077 I have to keep pointing out, the elevator doors remain closed when the floor you requested is reached. Nothing will happen to notify you that you have arrived and can exit. Being that you're unfamiliar with the game, you might be waiting for the door to open to show you which way to go because some elevators have door that are open across from each other instead of just the one door that you came in by. But no. In the futuristic world of Cyberpunk, in Night City, the stupidest city on Earth, the doors remain closed unless manually opened. (But by which button? F? R? .. MOUSE WHEEL?) Although even this was inconsistent because at some point the doors despite, having a prompt still come up to open them with F, would open when approached, but still not automatically. Someone actually had to program the elevator to work like this. Is this real life? Am I in Hell?

The overall theme I get from Cyberpunk's awful controls is that they apparently had developers who only play on console come up with all of the controls schemes for PC? It's clear no one who worked on this game has touched a PC before, with the exception of the PCs I assume they use to program the game in the first place? But why the devs, if PC is an afterthought to them and they don't understand what a PC game is, or how it's played, or what PC game conventions of the last decade are, they'd even release this on PC is baffling to me. But hey, here's another terrible PC port of a console game. Enjoy!","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Gameplay Mechanics"
"TL;DR: Is this game still chock-full of minor bugs and some game-breaking bugs? Yes, but it's fun and maybe worth it.

- There's more oddities in this game than your average Bethesda game would have (NPC weirdness, objects shifting when you turn to look at them, etc.) and some big bugs that still have yet to be fixed apparently (You can lose your ability to scan/quick-hack which may force you to go back to a previous save, and another one is Rogue's questline is bugged at the end and requires a lot of finagling to try and get it to work. I just gave up on it eventually as it wasn't the ending I was going for anyways.)

+ However, the combat is incredibly fun, albeit a bit too easy as you level up (seriously, I don't know how you can die after halfway through the game except for getting sniped.) You definitely feel like an all-powerful god once your build gets going, but I'm totally in for that, especially since this game is pretty much a looter shooter more than an RPG.

~ The voice acting is insanely good-- Except for Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves.) That man didn't even try, and it sucks every time his (major) character speaks, because it made me not give a shit about Johnny the entire game. V and the rest of the main cast are exceptional though. The ending is good, but leaves a lot of loose ends as sequel bait for sure.

+ Game looks incredible, and even on my medium-tier specs, I was able to enjoy a lot of it without any real hiccups. The world does feel pretty alive when you're moving around, and the sights to see are crazy good.

- A small gripe is that it feels like there's *too* many quest-givers. Every 5 seconds it seems like some random new side-character will call you and go ""You don't know me, but I've heard of you, and I got a job for ya."" Like, your quest log fills so fast from just leveling Street Cred or just running around to certain areas, it's a bit annoying.

~ Another issue I'd say is the lack of *wanting* to be in the world. Like, why would I bother going to another area of the city to buy a new apartment? I went back to V's apartment maybe twice by my own free will, because there was just no point with how much carrying capacity you're allowed. Same goes with buying the many vehicles available for purchase-- Who cares? You just drive from point A to point B in this game (because driving is atrociously bad.) It's a lot of fluff and not enough substance outside of story missions and side missions.

Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10, because it's carried by the combat, characters, and voice acting. The rest is very muddled and is either mid or bad. Hopefully when they release DLC for the game, they'll fix a lot of these issues, but after 2 years, not holding out hope.

"Where is the optimization that was promised? changed graphic settings to lowest and I'm getting sub 30 fps.
i7 - 7700k 4.2GHz

I know I don't have good specs but I expected more than 30 fps on lowest settings, which also make the game look a lot worse than i hoped.

"[h1] Review: Cyberpunk 2077 - A place where all kinds of people meet [/h1]
2020 | played time: 112 hours | 8/10 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a very story-centric role-play game based on a tabletop role-playing game from the late 1980s. It is developed and published by CD Project Red which pulls you into a potential dystopian future of our world.

The game begins in one of three variants in the year 2076 depending on the background choice made for V, the protagonist, in the character creation. The first act begins with V working as a mercenary in Night City. However, after working a few gigs life takes an unexpected turn. In the second act, V is hit by the reality of the aftermath of the preceding act and tries his best to survive. 
The story of V progresses through the main story missions and a vast number of optional side quests in the open world. The relating cutscenes and dialogues are mostly set within the open world creating immersion, however waiting for a quest to start at the given location can feel disruptive. The side quests also include options to have romantic affiliations with some characters depending on the gender and sexual orientation of the protagonist. Night City is traversed by V in first person, by different means of transport such as by foot or in vehicles. The latter has an unusually unnatural handling to it. The fighting system seems rather unrealistic in a game with an immersive intent where one shot to the head does not result in immediate death of either V or some enemies. One the other hand, this would make certain play styles such melee builds unviable. Cyberpunk 2077 invites to capture moments by providing a photo mode. The world provides several apartments, and looting is possible at almost every corner. However, a missing survival system makes the apartments and most of the lootable consumables close to obsolete. 
Cyberpunk 2077 can be modified which is made very accessible through third-party mod-menus. These modifications offer extensive possibilities to improve graphics and visuals, immersion and quality of life, or simply adding assets such as cars.
The world is created with a lot of attention to detail though the huge size of Night City and the vastness of the Badlands. The city and the surroundings can be explored by various modes of travel such as by foot, with the metro or with vehicles. The latter have a unique and unordinary futuristic design due to the view of the late 1980s. The city captures the feeling of a de facto corporatocracy and the power of corporation through the many towering skyscrapers and other buildings. The 3-dimensional possibilities of such building by using balconies, bridges and other levels reachable through elevators are well explored though substantial potential in this area is left untapped. Night City offers a huge variety of places including bars and other vendors which can be explored. A short fall is that not every street vendor is interactable by the protagonist. Completely missing but essential in a city of this size are supermarkets and at least one proper mall. Though there are several markets which are a substitute for the latter. The city offers different districts, each with a unique style and architecture reflecting the different socio-economic backgrounds living there. However, the gradient between districts can feel noticeably abrupt. The world experiences different weathers such as rainfall or fog. Analog to the previous aspect, the weather changes in the game are also very abrupt. Although the map is beautifully created, the slope changes in hilly areas are jaggy and some on- and off-ramps are unrealistically steep. While walking around in back alleys, piles of garbage can be found. However, due to the solid design of the assets any disturbance in the arrangement of the piles results in a hail of garbage bags.
The sound is very neatly designed. As such stepping on different materials makes different sounds. The immersion is furthered by having sounds for moving glass bottles and cans. The sound design of the vehicles is very well made. The radio and the music selection offer a good variety and various genres. All the characters’ voice actors did an astounding job capturing the emotions of the characters. Unfortunately, very noticeable is the sudden high-pitched detection sound which is played upon detection by an enemy while stealthing ripping the player out of the immersion.
Overall, the game is nicely balanced from a graphics point of view. Though the resolution of the textures and the fidelity of the assets are below the expectation of a game released in 2020. Additionally, though pleasing for the eye, the color grading is rather warm which is a mismatch for a dystopian futuristic megacity. Furthermore, the contrast in the game is tuned a bit too high resulting in an unrealistic feeling. Fortunately, modifications to adjust the postprocessing filters exist to remedy these shortcomings.
The main story of Cyberpunk 2077 is structured into three acts including a prologue, interlude and epilogue. Most notably, the storyline is anything but railroaded. As such a huge amount of optional side quests are available forming V’s story in Night City. The order for the parallel running side storylines is mostly irrelevant giving the sensation of immersion in the world and actually living the life of V. Also noticeable is the feeling of impact of the decisions that need to be made in the life of V and the related events and people. News coverage of world events also increases immersion and the sensation of living in Night City. Unfortunately, due to this setup, the urgency of progression created by certain events is disregarded and minorly breaks the logic of the plot. However, time is still given the due significance by having waiting times between quests and forcing the player to explore the world. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a must play for any singleplayer roleplay game enthusiast. It offers a great and very immersive experience. The story offers a lot of freedom in decisions all affecting the outcome in some way. Graphically, the game is not up to par with other titles released in that year. But the story and the world design are worth overlooking the minor flaws the game has.","Narrative, RPG Elements, World-Building"

Great game! great storytelling! for me just 2  minor bugs and running 60 fps on medium. i have a 2060 super and a i5 8400.,"Narrative, Technical Stability, Performance"
"Let me start with this,

Got the game when it was released on my PS5 , game looked wonderful, but ...ugh... it was full full of bugs, played it for a while but was impossible to even do some missions because some bugs, but I also had it on my PC day 1 as well. Honestly I stopped playing Cyberpunk for a good few months.

Recently I started playing again because of a lot of updates and wow, game is playable, ofc there is still stuff to be fixed but game is finally playable. Don't get me wrong there are some stuff in this game that i wish were fixed or done differently, i expected this game to be many many things, for me it was 50% - 50% .

Overall I loved the game, graphics, game play, story, characters . But still kinda sucks we got such a bit time with Jackie.

I would totally recommend this game to anyone that wants to play it and get lost in the Night City.

Also, for now , I am waiting for the new DLC that is about to come out and also, for the new Cyberpunk game that will be out in a couple of years, who know, maybe 2030 ? That would be good.  I bet the new Cyberpunk game will , and hopefully fully deliver to us, exactly what the devs dreamed, leaving behind what happened to the release of the first Cyberpunk. 

It was a great game, thank you CDPR , see ya in the new DLC and in a few years, Cyberpunk 2 :D

"I've put in 173 hours of game play. Honestly love the story. Can't wait to hop in and blast a few more baddies. I haven't found a game this addictive since Fallout 4 dropped us mod support. 
This game is running quite well on my 7 year old laptop, not really sure what all the gripe is about crashing and glitching. Its not really upset my game play that much. Taken with a helpful dose of salt knowing my PC has been through a lot over these last few years.
I've had my gripes about some of the actual game play. Of course i feel like i grew up playing games you cant change how they work. Even with current mods, I still choose to play the base game as it is. I take that as a good sign that I'm still enjoying the game the way it was built.
Mods will be this games saving grace. Its forced early launch has left that window wide open. And i would highly support the community mods and mods support.","Narrative, Technical Stability, Gameplay"
"Lets get this out of the way first, this game is a lot of fun. The combat is a good time. The story is great and filled with characters I enjoyed so much that I was sad when their quest lines ended. I am happy I finally bought the game, and even though I haven't finished it yet, I am very excited too.

However, this game is still buggy. I had a quest line I wanted to continue but couldn't get the character to call me no matter what. Had to look online and discover a way around the bug was to skip time and stand still for ten minutes. Doesn't feel great when interesting quest lines are halted for no apparent reason. If I hadn't wanted to continue it, I don't know if I would have realized it never came back around.

Also weird when there is a street of all one character model of a citizen. Cars headlights ahead of you will disappear and the cars will disappear with them. Just little odd things that just make the game less great. The presentation is so stellar though, that when these things happen it is hard to ignore. 

Also having characters just walk through cars or phasing through you feels a bit bizarre too. 

Still, a great game. Fun time. But quest bugs and some odds presentation glitches do detract from the game.","Gameplay Enjoyment, Narrative Quality, Technical Stability"

"Great game with a lot of potential, but it's now almost 2 years in the making and it's still got so many bugs that it's hard to go even an hour with a crash or session ending bug. Game froze when I equipped a weapon, first mission after prologue with Maelstrom has a bug and can't be completed (no real fix).

I want to leave a positive review because it is fun when it works, but it rarely works. Also the devs are dropping DLC and content instead of patches, it makes me question their priorities","Technical Stability, Developer Priorities, Game Potential"
"Started at the disastrous release and still fell in love with this world and its characters. Admittedly, I did not follow all the hype for the game until months before its expected release so all the broken promises and false advertising went over my head. Played it for what it was, a cool dystopian cyberpunk action story with Keanu, and glad to see the resurgence of players following some very much needed patches and the Edgerunners anime.","Technical Stability, Narrative Appeal, Marketing Hype"

"First of all, yes i really do recommend this game for ""visual freaks"" out there with neat set up, but but but, something i notice that, the steam version got a sized about 60 gigs. but the PS ver got 100 gigs, i dont know what it affects or is it because its compressed or whatsoever and i dont really care, but i do care about the gameplay and mechanics as i followed the witcher series (except gwent).

Second of all, about the story, yeah....i havent got that ""so far"" enough to bring the conclusion, but ive already expect that this game will not get ""too far"" as how the witcher progress through the timeline. And damn straight i am. It got a long main story but as like the witcher series, the amount of side quest and hints about the the difficulty on the sidequest, some items that required you to lvl up first before you can equip it, the skill tree, and the ""ETC"" stuff that youve familiar with in the witcher or fallout series......well, its all there.

Long story short, well as what i expected of how the game is being executed/released, it truly is a mixed of ""fps-adventure-action-rpg & fpsass/first person strange adventure stealth shooter"". Where does the ""strange"" part comes in? Ill just wrap it all up, i doooooo got sucked in, in the story progression, but.....yeah theres a but, BUT it is kinda strange that knowing that its now an fps game tho it have a a-rpg/rpg elements, for me the dev does mixed it up well, very well indeed, give credit to that, but if you dont play an rpg game series and get used/comfy in crafting system, looting an enormous amount of materials, the large amount of skill tree options, it does took you some time to get used too, or maybe.....a huge amount of time just to understand and get along, be friend, be a buddy with all that kind-o stuffffff'sssss or maybe just to do the right combo for your playstyle. Well as for me, it does give me a real vibes of ""im gonna play this MY-WAY"" with stealth thing, combo, skill tree, attachment and some sort of stuffs. But im just imagining that ""what about if im not an rpg guy, and i just want some action""........in that case, yea id still recommend this game, but..........you really need to spent hours on gettin a grip on the mechanics & how to play the game properly, afterall, its somewhat an rpg game, so you do need to remind that at some point, this game needed you to grind for exp & items. Well.....tough luck on wishin that the devs will shift sideways more to the ""action only"" stuff.

On the contrary, the game feels awesome, MEANING: big map to explore, many quest (even tho sometimes will get repetitive enough), cool voice acting, best graphics (im using rtx for short), the movement (well its still a bit strange, but if you already got comfortable playing PUBG, well you wont have any issue about the movements), good character editing (not that detailed but good, way way way more better than the witcher), detailed story line (moving forward & back like its predecessor....the witcher.....again....sorry).

For me, it does worth the money and the waiting time for the game released, i mean with big time mechanic & graphic like that, jeez if they sell the collectors edition on steam (digital game but send the goodies to my door step) id be down for that. 

Thats it from me, cant describe enough, its just a review not a blog, just givin impression, but note that im a witcher & fallout fan, so dont get me wrong about if i say ""the game is good"", but not sure for everybody.

"Running this on a AMD Ryzen 9 5900x and Nvidia FE 3070, so definitely got the power to have some fun with this game. There's a few bugs, but it's only been out a couple of days and none of the one's I've come across are show-stoppers. 

The controls take a bit of getting used to, but other than that I can't complain. The environment is incredibly immersive and alive, exploration is definitely fun. Story-wise, I'm enjoying it so far, but be warned this game has the world's longest prologue :D

Based on my experience so far, I'd highly recommend it.","Technical Stability, Immersion and Exploration, Narrative"

"This is a perfectly AVERAGE game. Not groundbreaking, not unplayable, a solid C+/B-. I might pay $15-20 for this game.

Appraises first, the aesthetic is all there and it seems a lot of effort was put into world-building. The setting is cohesive and believable. It's a cool concept, and if I don't request a refund, I will see it to the end. BUT...

Ignoring the bugs, which I believe are fixable and probably will be fixed, there are significant problems fundamentally with the game. 
- The keybinding are incredibly counter-intuitive and can only be changed by accessing your configuration files, not through the game.
- How to access your inventory, add points to your skill tree, what the different types of points do, other basic RPG features are not explained. How to shoot is explained; how to go into your inventory and equip any weapon is not.
- You can't equip things in your inventory while looking in your storage; you have to close your storage and separately open your inventory to equip.
- Appearance customization is limited and cannot be changed after you first create your character.
- The driving scheme is insane--camera is positioned with respect to the world, not the car, so if you are driving north and turn west, your camera stays facing north until you adjust your mouse. You end up spending most of the time running around the city or fast traveling because it's superior to driving.
- I'm not very deep into the story yet, but comparing my friend's and my experiences, it sounds like the story doesn't change much between paths (corpo, streetkid, nomad), just the tone of certain dialogue options and prelude, and that your action and dialogue choices don't have much consequence on the story (someone further in, please correct me if I'm wrong. I am hoping I am).
[b] TLDR, I want to like this game, but there are a lot of fundamental problems with the story and mechanics that I don't think can be fixed with patches. It's not garbage, it's not unplayable, but it's not worth $60. Wait a few months until at least some bugs are fixed and the price drops.

"A true masterpiece. I completed a full playthrough (60 hours) about two years ago, and recently dove back in with Phantom Liberty for another 60 hours. There were moments when I had to pause the game just to share with my significant other the wild twists in the quests and the weight of the consequences from my decisions. The best part? I know I'll do another full playthrough someday, and it’ll lead to completely different outcomes. This game is beyond exceptional—'masterpiece' is the only word that truly captures it.","Narrative, Replayability"
"How I feel about Cyberpunk2077 so far:

- Good points:
Storylines: This game has storylines which can't be described with words. So exciting, amazing and full of suprises are only a few words which I can use. An extraordinary creation which took its time. 

Graphics: The game also has gorgeous graphics. Everything is so beautiful to the eyes and with rtx on it is even better! The views u can experience are amazing and feel almost as if they are real.

Price: The price is absolutely amazing for a game like this, I would even be ready to pay more for this work of art.

Pc/system: Even tho the game has some fps issues for some people with lower end systems, if u have a new generation gpu you will be able to run the game smoothly at atleast 60fps or much more, but for sure needs to be more optimised.

- Bad points:
Guns/Mechanics : The only thing that disapointed me a little is the combat mechanics which are.. how do I say this weird. Apart from the lack of different types of guns and options to buy and customize them, enemies take way too long to be killed with common guns and other types. Imo it is not really fun to have to shoot 2 full mags onto a guy for him to die. Ofc if u manage to get your hands on the legendary or epic guns it is a little better.

Cars: I was really suprised when I learned that you'll only be able to buy cars from fixers in Cyberpunk 2077. They only offer random cars, so u cannot really get the car u actually want to own, which is kinda sad even tho u don't really need to buy cars into this game acknowledging the fact u can steal any car u want by shooting the driver and hoping in.

Bugs: The game may have a few bugs but trust me, they will be far gone and forgoten in a few weeks. Every game has her bugs in the begining, but with all the hard worcking and skilled people behind Cyberpunk 2077 they will be erased without you realising they even existed.

Character Customisasion: Even tho Cyberpunk2077 offers things no other games do, the lack of haristyles, colors, tatoos... and a few more things are missing from what I've seen.

Conclusion: An extraordinary game which fits the price and expectations by a lot. The game can be run very smoothly on lots of systems but ofc won't run very well on some lower end ones. Buy the game now and enjoy the amazing work of art.

Hope this helped some of you which had troubles deciding to buy the game or pass for now.","Narrative, Graphics, Consumer Value"

"Completed the game and enjoyed it, but I didn't really know if I liked it until I was about 20 hours into the story. It was a good games, but it felt a bit hollow. There are a lot of bugs in the game, choices you make in the story don't really matter or affect the ending like they did in the WItcher 3, and overall it's just not that much of an immersive experience. A game I heavily compared it to was Red Dead Redemption 2 because I had just replayed it prior to getting Cyberpunk, and also because its probably one the best single-player RPG's out there, both in terms of story and technical quality.

I'm not gonna say the game's a buggy, unoptimized mess because that's not what I experienced. I did experience some bugs, but none were game breaking. There were instances where a mission was bugged and I had to reload the game, but nothing that actually kept me from progressing. The game ran well enough on my mid-range PC, ryzen 3700x, 2060 super, 16gb ddr4 2133, but there some graphical issues like after images on vehicles, certain areas of the city lowering performance, etc.. 

I do recommend this game, just not in its current state and definitely not at it's full price. Wait for more patches/updates for CDPR to fix/finish the game, and also wait for it to go on sale. I honestly wouldn't pay more $40 for it right now.","Narrative, Technical Stability, Immersion"

"I like just about everything about this game except for it's story. I like the combat, it feels really cool and I think there are entire builds that I have never even touched. High risk high reward throwing knife build, charge up tech weapons, monstrous high strength pistols, melee, hacking, all kinds of great stuff. I like the world, I like the gameplay, I even like a lot of the quests(shoutouts to Brendan over by Megabuilding H8). The game works fine for me at this point as well.

The problem I have with the game is that it has the kinda story that I don't like to hang around in for the length of a whole open world game. I feel like it's well written and all, but I don't really want to be thinking about my own mortality and finding out the fate of the other people in my crew(some of this stuff can get EXTREMELY dark), for the length of time required to finish an open world game like this. I get the same feeling after playing through the main questline for a while that I do after reading the news, which I think is intended, but it just kinda starts to really suck the fun away for me personally.

Again I love playing the game, I bought it on Steam and GOG and even installed it on my steam deck to play with it there(bought it on GOG first at launch that's where most of my playtime is). But I don't think I'm ever going to finish the story because it really strongly feels like it's not for me.","Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability, Narrative Themes"

"I couldn't recommend this more. They're getting slaughtered with the ""official"" reviews but I think by now we all know not to trust the media. Plus I think it's messed up that they were getting their share price shorted into oblivion. Hopefully that changes post GME. Politics aside here's my review: 

The graphics are insane, this is the new crysis for sure and the atmosphere is incredible, I've wanted a game like this to come out for god knows how long since cyberpunk is one of my favorite genres of fiction. It meets the mark there and exceeds it. Just make sure you're ok with spending a fair bit on a PC for it. Turn DLSS on too and it'll hover around 60fps on a 3090. Worth it though. 

Story wise there's a lot of depth there, I don't want to ruin it with spoilers but they get the classic philosophical problems that the genre is supposed to deal with. These are questions about identity, consciousness, and where the lines might blur in the future between a person and a machine. More than that though it's accessible, and thoroughly well written. Reeves does an impeccable job. The whole atmosphere of the game changes for his sections and it's hilarious but at the same time achingly cool. Just yunno, painfully cool lol. Excessive in the best way. All the characters are very well written and acted. I straight up fell for Judy ;D

They don't shy away from creating a videogame that's adult too, which I honestly respect. I'm a middle aged dude so I hate it when things are half arsed and there's not enough gore or sex. C'mon other game devs we can take it. \m/

The side missions range from being just random encounters with gangs to a good amount of deeper stuff, I haven't really even scratched the surface there. The cool thing is that there are some really, and I mean REALLY freakin weird side missions. Again, no spoilers, I wish I could but it just wouldn't be fair. 

I'm 76 hours in and I love it. Gameplay wise it feels like we finally got a high-tech version of fallout or skyrim. There's lots of depth in the tech trees but I feel like it doesn't really matter where you put your stats most of the time. That said it's very enjoyable and visceral to blow someone's brains out with one of the more advanced weapons or cave someone's chest in with a giant hammer. 10/10 there. 

I think the main problem with the game is just that the corpos nuked the official reviews, so most NPC's are hating on it. Plus a lot of people probably kept binging on hype. I didn't see more than 5 minutes of footage before buying the game and that was mostly by accident. It's fantastic. A classic. It's not even that buggy tbh. I mean shit some of the stuff I used to see in skyrim was way, way worse. The game is fantastic, next gen, and I think that scares the competition so they're pulling some dirty tricks.","Visuals and Atmosphere, Performance, Narrative Depth"

Good day,
Be aware this is a long and detailed review with SPOILERS.

I started to play the game when it came out, but after some time, I felt like this game deserves to be played when it is more fluid and just generally more processed then what it was back then. So I waited until I felt it was on a satisfactory level, and then I started a new campaign. 

I will speak only about the present state of the game, I will not speak about already repaired bugs from now on.

First I will go with the rant, and later with the blessings. 

Rant part one glitches: 

1. The game still has many glitches, like invisible or blinking phones and tablets, peoples clipping through things or each other, floating food and I think I saw a guy with smoker shoes on sometime ago, seriously the thing spat out smoke like a steam train or something. 
The most annoying ones, at least for me are the following ones: 
-Mantis blade crouch position right hand looks really weird around the wrist area (on female body I don't know if the male body has this glitch)  
-The grey texture that blinks through your character skin when undressed around the shoulders and chest-neck area if I remember correctly also on the female body model.
-The character head shadow, that makes you feel like a skinhead, there is no shadow for your hair, I am not sure if wearing a headgear changes anything about the shadow, I don't really used headgear too many times except sunglasses.
-When you climb stairs, your characters legs often get stuck in a weird crouch like position and float away in that funny pose. 
-The character model shadows are generally stiff, but when you use mantis blade in combat mode, it is really hard to look at and beyond disturbing with some of the normal weapon armament too like the swords. 
-There is one glitch when you drive a car in third person view and when you leave the car and the camera changes back to first person there is a big grey glitch usually from the right side of the car when you leave the car from the driving seat. It is not always present. 
-There is a big glitch that made me use the cars in third person most of the time, if I want to be more specific there is two. reason for that. First one: you basically can't see out of the car good enough to drive efficiently, literally can't see half the street because I sit too low or maybe the character is just too short? I don't know but it is annoying. The other one, is even more crazy, in some of the cars usually with the nomad armored cars where instead of glass they use display type windscreen or something like that when you turn the car towards the smallest of lights the screen turns into a completely blinding white light, and there is no way to see anything at all, only if you focus the character view to an unnatural angle and look down to your legs then the view clears out but if you look back witch happens automatically through driving you will be blinded again.  There are some cars with display windscreens that are not affected by this, like the basilisk and so on.
-There is one more, and I am not sure if it is intended or not but it's still annoying. Around the end of the game I basically found a silver hand in my inventory. It is in the quest item area of the inventory, where you can see every item you found through the game. So I clicked on it, and to my not so small surprise V put it on her left hand. It is not a normal silver hand but the hazy version that activates in times when Silverhand is in control. To be straight for a time I was very happy about this, then the rosy clouds dispersed and I tried to put it down. But it stuck, so I panicked asked Victor for help but he didn't see any problem and chased me out of the shop so. I played through the game and Jhonny is not even here anymore, but I still have his arm, it would be a nice souvenir, if I could turn off the effect at will. Just saying.

2. Rant about things that I missed and would not be that much more work to make them (except brain dance).

-The obvious: customisation of character looks in game. This is so basic I wont even go into why would it be good, you guys already put this function into some of your games. 
-Walk button switch for PC players this was in your games already too, and I can't fathom why wasn't implemented here. 
-Mini games, the hours that I wasted on Gwent, nothing new here, I am not saying that you should put Gwent into this game, but something where you can use your money is needed! The whole game feels empty, because you can't use your money that you work for any normal way, you can become a terminator, jump 10 meter high but you can't play a simple game in a gamer corner or bet on the pachinko machines, you can't even use the bd-s that you bought and I am saying the bd-s creates so many possibilities and not using that feature to the fullest is a sin. In the end it is a shame that you have less possibilities to waste your money and time in a high-tech ultra modern city that was raised on primary desires then in a witcher like farming countryside. 

3. Rant about unreasonable choices: 
- This game is an adult game created to be played by adults 18 + only.  I understand the possibility to use the characters with underclothes and without them for preferences. But if I chose the first that means I don't want underclothes on my character. I don't get it why would half nude be good, and totally nude not? Especially if in the inventory you are nude anyway and even in some of the scenes? You guys gave us only the illusion of choice here, and even that is in a very unreasonable way. If you think that walking around the street totally nude is not realistic, than make a joke out of it, for example NCPD arrests you on the street and you have to pay money for public lechery or something.
- Many sex scenes are frustratingly prudish because of the same reason (don't cut out the good part), if you want to save us from depravity I would say you are not in charge of that, any kid nowadays can write three word in search engine and see things like even I would fall out of my chair from. 

Now comes the good part! 

1. The characters: I have never played a game that has this realistic and rich type of characters. Every main character is a unique world and this is not exaggeration, the voice actors did an outstanding job and the animators made them become alive and natural. The only games that I find close to this character uniqueness is my old favorites Dragon Age: Origins, KOTOR and the Witcher 3, but this game goes beyond those in this by far. Truly marvelous job.
2. Action execution: Most of the main battle or action scenes are ridiculously good there was some strange moments through the scripted fights but I can easily look passed those because of the overall coolness of the whole act. Those movie like moments usually left me awed and speechless for minutes. 
3. Ending/endings: There is not another game or movie that I played or watched that made me feel this close to death it creeps me out still when I think back to it, I played out the game with the Rogue way and I was shell shocked and I think I was depressed for few hours after that. The feeling of helplessness, hope, courage and panic, before the inevitable end.  That was deep. I am not even sure if I would want to go through that again if I had a choice to forget it. Some of my close relatives died a few months back, after a long-term illness I think I got a taste of what they went through, and it hit me in the guts quite literally.
 
Summary:

This game is a big gem that needs a lot of polishing and patience to reach its potential. In my play-through I felt the creators desire to make something remarkable, through they sweat, blood and tears. 

There were frustrating moments in the game, yet in retrospect I can only applaud.

The Acknowledgement
Let me start by saying this; I wish I liked Cyberpunk 2077, and in theory I do. Sadly, that is only in theory.
Additionally, with my background in business, I am sympathetic to the plight the company.
The impressive marketing leading up to the launch combined with the exceptional reputation of CD Projekt Red (Here after referred to as CDPR) had me within inches of investing in the company. Instead, I did what I never do; I intentionally bought the game on day one at full price, intended to reward a game and developer that were guaranteed to be so exceptional.
Six weeks later the only thing I feel is betrayal and disappointment.
I understand why this happened too. When every delay of the launch causes a forty percent dip in the stock of your company and loss of investor confidence, it makes a certain sense to release a game that can be fixed later. That certain sense is a short-term financial sense. And it was the absolute wrong answer.
This was the moment to show backbone and play the long game, releasing the game when it was finished as promised and showering in the praise and money long awaited but well deserved. But that is not what happened. Cooler, more rational heads did not prevail and the gamers, the employees, and the company are paying for it every day.

The Main Issue
Let’s talk about the main issue.
This is not the game I paid for.
This is not the game I waited for with bated breath for eight years.
This is not a game I would buy had I known the enormous gap between the image projected and the slap of lackluster reality.
The game I have been playing (when I can force myself to) is half of a chintzy, incomplete Bethesda RPG that feels like it punishes you for playing it. 
I use the reference to Bethesda RPGs (Any Fallout [Except New Vegas, although not Bethesda] or Elder Scrolls game ever) very very intentionally and it is applicable here because of the many similarities and poor design choices made. So, let’s power hammer this out.
As with any Bethesda RPG you can expect the following: 

-(Menu Simulator) 
You will spend no less than half of any gaming session ripped from the world you are trying to immerse yourself in, staring blankly at a poorly executed menu instead. Typically this happens because in your desperate attempt to earn money or collect the best loot/items/crafting material, you will pick up almost everything you see, leading to over-encumberment and a trip into the game menu where you will agonize over what to keep and what to break down/sell/dispose of. Having done so, you will close the menu, walk five feet to the next corpse and begin the process all over again.
Solution; Give V a backpack drone that can deposit loot intelligently based off player preferences. Perhaps it can make trips to V’s apartment where you can sort through it later, or you give the drone instructions about what items you are not interested in and it can dispose/sell/breakdown for you. Also, limit how many guns and items V can equip. Make him choose a loadout with limited resources at his apartment instead of letting him carry around twenty guns, four hundred hypo’s and eighty grenades. The drone can resupply him if he runs out between jobs.

-(Item Fomo [Fear of Missing Out])
Compounding the above problem is the issue that the world is littered with useful and useless items. Even in the middle of combat, you will never feel free to progress until you have inspected every corpse and every box and every item laying about. You will stop advancing and intentionally take damage just to make sure you haven’t missed something incredible or even something slightly helpful, which is about as immersion breaking as you can get. Suddenly you don’t feel like a cybernetically enhanced mercenary of the dark future; you feel like a high-risk scavaging, cleaning lady suffering from intense OCD. If like myself you actually have Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies, this is likely to make the experience incredibly stressful rather than enjoyable. Gearbox’s Borderlands games suffer from the same issue; sure they’ve got a billion guns, but player’s don’t want to spend five billion minutes figuring out which is the best one and if they might have missed a better one.
Solution; Declutter or make further use of the drone discussed above. Anyone in touch with reality knows you aren’t going to get gun parts out of condoms and ashtrays and they aren’t worth their weight in Eddies. Either let them fulfill their intended purpose or let us let them go, please.

-(Tiered Loot)
I cannot emphasize enough how much tiered loot does not belong in this game. You want to put in some unique weapons and cyberware? Sure, by all means. But when you introduce Tiers you create a hierarchy, and no one is satisfied with a hierarchy unless you are at the top. So if you put twelve legendary/iconic weapons and cyberware in your game, the truth is those are the only weapons and cyberware in your game, because no one will be satisfied with anything else. Combined that with the price of purchasing some of the items, and it flat out doesn’t make financial sense to waste your money buying anything but the best.
As a secondary issue, tiered loot forces players into an immersion breaking choice; do I stay immersed in the game and try (and fail) to be satisfied with whatever items I have, or do I stop playing and look up guides on how to find the best items and just make a beeline for them using knowledge the player has and the character wouldn’t. 
Tiered loot has a place; it’s called Fortnite. Leave it there.
Solution; Rather than create hierarchies, give us variety and customization. Give the game more weapons and more versatility and actual meaningful ways of customizing them to our play style. There should be a full fledged system at V’s apartment wherein you can change out every piece on a weapon and see it reflected in visuals and performance. Just don’t create a hierarchy within that customization. Please.
And if you really want to include iconic weapons, make it so V can receive one absolutely unique weapon based on how V plays, similar to how Johnny Silverhand was gifted his one-of-a-kind pistol by Malorian.

-(No meaningful customization)
For a game that centers around literal body modification, there is almost no significant customization options for V. Sure, you get a standard (not exceptional as promised) character creator at the start, but aside from visiting a ripperdoc, you are locked in from there. Visiting a ripperdoc is also incredibly underwhelming after your first time at Victor’s. One time and one time only, you get the chance to see yourself go under the digital knife, get ripped apart and emerge stronger. After that, its every interaction with a ripperdoc is back to being a menu simulator. You will emerge changed and upgraded, but the way it happens is so lack luster you won’t believe anything was done to you at all.
Upgrading weapons and cloths is much the same. You can install mods to improve stats, but that’s it. And since you don’t see it happen or the change reflected physically it is really as though you haven’t done it at all. 
Solution; Rework everything. V should be able to get a haircut somewhere in Night City. And ripperdocs should have some actual impact. At minimum I want to see V get sedated and then wake up groggy in the chair. Ideally I want V to be conscious and watch unique cutscenes that emphasize that my character is trading away their humanity in order to survive. And there needs to be significantly more variety in cyberware. I want to see and weigh the difference between replacing my arm with a Militech arm and or an Arisaka arm. Heck, even visibly replacing a single arm would be an improvement right now instead of this barebones flesh-colored everything stand-in.","Consumer Value, Business Sympathy, Marketing Hype"

"The only problem I had with this game was one broken side quest because a body vanished before I could collect the thing I needed due a cranky over sized robot.

Sadly, the side quests make the majority of the game time as I felt the main story line was pretty sleepy and very short. There are a lot of things to do, but after awhile it's kind of repetitive and once you get high enough on a level....well....for me it was mostly just scanning people and zapping them with a hack which meant my no-fatality play through was mostly hacking and on a rare occasion knocking someone down with a bat or use Skippy to ""permanently cripple people"".

I don't know about the other endings yet, but I'm looking forward to additional content.","Technical Stability, Narrative, Gameplay Loop"
bought this game to test my pc,"PC Performance Testing, Technical Stability"
"

A quick note: I played this on a low-end PC, but because of that, my expectations for visual bugs are lower. 

The positives:

The moment I launched Cyberpunk 2077, the game almost immediately hooked me into its immersive world of Night City. I quickly got invested in the first main mission called “The Heist”, and was even emotionally invested in the supporting character Jackie. The combat in the game is exhilarating, giving the player four main options for playing through the various missions(Guns, Hacking, Melee, and Stealth), allowing and forcing players to mix and match these to create a unique playstyle for each person. The story was so great that I played through the entire main questline without completing any side quests (Besides Panam’s and Judy’s as their questlines are attached to the main one) on my first run through. On my second run of Cyberpunk, I completed the vast majority of the side quests, leveling my character up to level 50 (the maximum level), and was shocked to find that the critical decision making found in the main quest was still largely intact in even the more mundane ‘gigs’ albeit to a lesser level. While traversing the streets of Night City, I discovered a large cast of unique characters from a talking gun or vending machine to the future mayor of the city. The impacts you have on the world are massive, from bringing down or raising up a gang, to deciding the future of the biggest corporation and even helping determine the next mayor. There are also many little secrets hidden in the game, and each of these little easter eggs gives a feeling of accomplishment when you find them (especially the one pertaining to the secret final ending). While having the internet available to us now does greatly diminish this feeling, a player is fully capable of stumbling upon them without outside help, and that fact makes them feel special. This game feels like a combination of Borderlands and the Witcher and it is pretty fun. 

Each type and subtype of gun felt special in the way they can be used. For example, a smart shotgun and a power precision rifle are vastly different in their uses, making using each type of weapon feel special. The best experience of using weapons and armor in the game involves crafting them yourself, especially because the best items you can get in the game are made not found (even if the recipe for them is found), which gives a unique experience to many people as they find the type(s) of gun, bludgeon, or sword that fits them best. Any of these legendary items can be modded and/or upgraded to be the best weapon in the game, as no type of weapon is truly better than the other. The system of mods that the game has allows for even more customization.

Stealth is a legitimate option in the game, especially when combined with hacking to allow you to defeat a group of enemies without ever firing a shot. The option of a one-hit-kill in takedowns allows for a player without great weapons to take down many foes. The vast variety of options for hacking allows a player to choose how they wish to play, without really punishing the player for not using it at all. For example, you can do anything from making machinery malfunction to causing a person to kill himself. This allows players who would rather avoid a firefight a great option for dealing with enemies.

The developers have been rapidly patching the game, and are even adding DLC “early next year”, and the biggest of the bugs have been patched by now, with more being patched every day. 
 
A quick thing about one of the controversies surrounding this game (the accusations of transphobia), Cyberpunk is in many ways criticism of consumerist culture, of both the megacorporations and the customers that make it up. Because of this, there are some advertisements that you will see in-game that are degenerate. However, in one of the most fun side quests (a racing sidequest) the main character that you are helping is a person who is transgender. 

The negatives: 

	There are many visual bugs in this game, such as glitching smoke, and textures that do not load quickly or correctly often. These issues are of course going to happen unless you have the top hardware. Sometimes these can be comical (such as NPCs randomly T-posing), but they ultimately break some of the immersion of the game. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that requires its players to save frequently just in case of a bug that is more serious than these visual issues. For example, an NPC may not talk with you or a door might not open, or a crafting material may not appear in your inventory once you obtain it. These bugs are a much bigger problem, and although CD Projekt Red’s team is fixing these constantly, there are still many of them out there.

	On a note of lesser importance, the game fails to explain the importance of crafting, and even though I would consider myself fairly well versed in RPGs, my first playthrough did not really go into crafting, and my experience was more negative for it. The same is true for the system of mods, in which Cyberpunk does not tell you that different mods scale differently on different weapons. A combination of crafting with weapon mods greatly increases the ability of a character to take down large groups of enemies. This shows as, on my first playthrough on the ‘normal’ difficulty, there were missions that bordered on impossible for my character to complete certain main missions, compared to my second run where my character beat the hardest mission (Don’t) Fear the Reaper on his first try on the hardest difficulty. The game also poorly explains implants and hacking, both of which can be integral parts of a person’s playthrough, requiring timely and costly in-game exploration of these features (and that’s if a player knows where to look). The gathering of materials that are necessary for crafting can be a grinding pain (unless an impatient player uses item duplicating exploits) These things mean that it is hard for someone not versed in open-world RPGs to pick up Cyberpunk 2077 and understand it, which could lead to a lot of frustration. 

	While each type and subtype of gun feel quite different from each other, melee weapons (with the exception of the implants of the mantis blades and monowire) do not feel too different from each other, and have limited variety in them. Even though one of the potentially best melee weapons found in Night City is a dildo, wielding it and using a wrench in-game do not feel different.

	There are some parts of the story, specifically the side stories, that seemed to have been bigger plots to immerse oneself in, but these plots were either not fully finished or were removed (possibly due to the game’s rushed launch). For example, one of the more fascinating stories is that of the future mayor of Night City, but while you get to uncover a massive conspiracy involving them, there is nothing that comes from there. There are many situations similar to this that the player will get excited to experience only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them as they realize that the rest of the plot is not yet in the game. Inconsistencies are also present occasionally, such as the fact that although the police are withdrawn from the districts of Pacifica and the Badlands, committing crimes in either of these places will cause them to spawn on you. The police in this game also do not arrive in cars or any form of vehicle, nor do they run at you, but rather blink into existence around you. These same cops will also fire on you for being in their sight for too long (despite having not committed a crime) but will forget about any atrocities you have done if you simply run several blocks away from them.


TL;DR:
	Although Cyberpunk has more than its fair share of bugs, and it’s systems are not always fully explained to the player, the game is immersive with a fantastic story and gripping combat.

The loot treadmill is a little silly sometimes; all clothes have an armor value and you can find basketball shorts with triple the armor of your mil-tech fatigues. 
They've done a great job of incorporating your character's stats and backgrounds into your interactions with the NPCs, and to a more limited extent with the environments as well.

But I think the deciding factor in my ""Very Much Recommended"" is that this game is immersive in a way you can't easily define.  Whenever I check the time it's 1-2 hours later than I expected.  Maybe it's the city environments or the world building, but Cyberpunk 2077 is genuine 100% pure escapism.  

At least until you get the bug where your peepee pokes through your pants.

Still great otherwise.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Loop, RPG Integration"
"beautiful game, graphics, story line, it is a intensive game to run however, , plenty of builds and customization with your character and looks, the one thing i do wish there was more of was romance options, you are kinda locked to 2, depending on what you make your character although theres a total of like 5 i think, also, once you do romance someone, the ""dates"" are literally a few texts, either them coming over or you going over, and a few repeated lines of dialogue, good game, but like 40 hours in 4 days, ( i like trains ) ( hehe funny way of saying i wanna die)","Graphics and Narrative, Performance, Romance Options"

"If you didnt buy into the hype on this game you probably wont be disappointed. No it is not the open world rpg to rule all open world rpgs, but im having a great time.

"So I have 33 hours on cyberpunk now. It's December 30th and I got it for Christmas. I'm not gonna say what some people might want to hear but I'll say what I truly believe about the game.

This game has a lot of bugs. It's been delayed for between a year and two, and many people are disappointed. But when you play it, it's a different feeling. Driving around the streets you can see the love they put into the game; making it look great, and building the world around you.

SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.
The story I think is great. It's not just your average redemption story; Silverhand in your head really does add to it, as he converses with you time to time and you get to choose how your character interacts with him. Either he's an enemy, the guy who intervenes and contradicts your thoughts. Or, he's a friend, a guy who just wants the same thing as you: to stay alive.
The combat doesn't have many flaws either. The cover system is fine, I find it very useful for fighting high level enemies who you gotta be careful around. The guns all have their own special abilities and flaws, but ultimately you get to pick the one that fits your style. Having three weapon slots at once is great as well for quick switching and you can switch out what is in what slot anytime. The stealth is also very good. Using hacks to distract enemies is fun and the hiding containers can mostly fit more than one body for when there are a lot of enemies.

I could go on for hours about what I think about this game, but I don't want to. You should play the game yourself. In my firm opinion, the game's qualities overpower the bugs- because everyday the developers are working hard to fix them.","Technical Stability, World Immersion, Narrative"

"Cyberpunk 2077, developed by CD Projekt Red, is a monumental action role-playing game that has captured the imagination of players worldwide. Released in December 2020, the game immerses players in the dystopian future of Night City, a sprawling urban environment brimming with advanced technology, unchecked corporate power, and the struggle for identity. Despite a turbulent launch marred by technical issues, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a significant achievement in modern gaming, celebrated for its ambitious narrative, intricate design, and detailed world-building. This analysis evaluates the game's strengths and weaknesses, highlighting its profound impact on the gaming landscape.

Strengths of Cyberpunk 2077

1. Unparalleled World-Building

Night City is a testament to meticulous design and attention to detail, offering one of the most immersive open-world experiences in gaming. Its neon-soaked streets, imposing skyscrapers, and culturally distinct districts create a dynamic and authentic urban environment. Each area, from the industrial grittiness of Watson to the luxurious allure of Westbrook, feels alive and integral to the city’s identity. The game’s dynamic day-night cycle and atmospheric weather systems further enhance its realism, drawing players deeply into the world.

2. Complex Storytelling

The narrative of Cyberpunk 2077 is a compelling exploration of identity, ambition, and power. Centered on V’s struggle to remove the Johnny Silverhand engram from their mind, the story delves into existential questions and critiques of corporate greed. The main storyline is enriched by intricately crafted side quests, many of which rival the primary narrative in depth and moral complexity. These stories often challenge players with difficult choices, underscoring the game’s thematic focus on consequence and agency.

3. Customization and Playstyle Flexibility

Cyberpunk 2077 excels in character customization, allowing players to define V’s appearance, background, and skills. This freedom extends to gameplay, where diverse builds—ranging from stealth-focused netrunners to combat-heavy solos—provide multiple avenues for approaching challenges. The robust progression system, featuring perks and cyberware upgrades, ensures that players can adapt their playstyle to suit their preferences.

4. Engaging Gameplay Systems

The game offers a blend of first-person shooting, melee combat, and hacking mechanics, creating a versatile and engaging experience. The variety of weapons, gadgets, and cybernetic enhancements allows for creative problem-solving in combat and exploration. Additionally, the inclusion of drivable vehicles and fast travel contributes to a seamless traversal of Night City’s expansive terrain.

5. Exceptional Sound Design

Cyberpunk 2077’s auditory elements elevate its immersive qualities. The soundtrack’s fusion of electronic synth and intense rhythms perfectly complements the game’s tone. Moreover, the voice acting—with standout performances from Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand and Cherami Leigh as female V—adds emotional weight and authenticity to the characters.

Weaknesses of Cyberpunk 2077

1. Technical Instability

The game’s launch was overshadowed by widespread technical issues, particularly on older consoles. Bugs, crashes, and performance inconsistencies severely hindered the experience for many players. Although subsequent patches have addressed numerous problems, the initial release tarnished the game’s reputation and highlighted the risks of over-ambitious development timelines.

2. Underdeveloped AI Systems

The behavior of non-playable characters (NPCs) and enemies often falls short of expectations. Pedestrians and traffic react minimally to player actions, breaking immersion, while enemy AI lacks sophistication in combat scenarios. These shortcomings detract from the otherwise vibrant world of Night City.

3. Limited Impact of Choices

While marketed as an RPG, Cyberpunk 2077’s role-playing depth is somewhat constrained. Dialogue choices and quest outcomes often lead to similar conclusions, reducing the sense of agency. Additionally, the life path system, which influences V’s backstory, has a surprisingly minimal effect on the overarching narrative.

4. Missed Gameplay Opportunities

Certain gameplay elements that were heavily promoted, such as dynamic police systems and extensive body modifications, are either underwhelming or absent. These omissions underscore the gap between the game’s initial promises and its final implementation, leaving some players feeling let down.

5. Overwhelming Interface Design

The game’s user interface can be daunting for newcomers. A cluttered map and complex menus complicate navigation, while managing inventory and upgrades requires significant effort. This steep learning curve may alienate players unfamiliar with intricate systems.

Conclusion

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game of immense ambition, characterized by its striking narrative depth and breathtaking world design. Despite its undeniable strengths, the game’s shortcomings—notably its technical instability and unrealized potential—highlight the challenges of delivering on ambitious creative visions. For players who value immersive storytelling and rich, atmospheric settings, Cyberpunk 2077 offers an unparalleled experience. However, those seeking flawless execution or seamless gameplay mechanics may find it falls short of expectations.

Ultimately, Cyberpunk 2077 stands as both a remarkable achievement and a cautionary tale in modern game development, illustrating the delicate balance between ambition and execution. Its legacy will undoubtedly shape the industry’s approach to creating expansive, narrative-driven worlds.","World-Building, Narrative, Technical Stability"

"I didn't expect much from this game but I was still left feeling let down.

Most of my frustration (other than the wasted money) was down to not knowing what was happening. It felt like joining Games of Thrones in the 5th series! I have no idea who the character is or what they are doing. There's so much lingo in there that the story is like watching Bridge of Spies or some other film you pretend to understand, but secretly don't. You often get the chance to make conversation choices but given there are so many weird names for people, places, corporations, robots, computer chips etc I never really knew which option I should choose. It just adds to the confusion.

I was able to play on high settings at 1080p/50fps if I used Balanced FSR (it took about 3hrs of experimenting) but even the visuals didn't impress much, ...too much saturated colour for me.

I also didn't like the feel of the mechanics. It was a bit too Doom or Dishonored type feel. Some may like it but it's not for me. Maybe I just prefer third-person. I managed to get to the first 'shoot the baddies' part and I had no chance of hitting anyone unless I was really close. Even then, it seemed to take 10 headshots to drop someone, which is silly!

Also, why the character customisation (right down to pubic hair length and nipple size) if it's in first person? 

To try to acknowledge some positives...
I play on openSUSE and gtx1070 and it worked great. Not a single crash in the 8hrs I tinkered and played. I saw the odd glitch (the big guy you are with walking through a car, for instance) and the characters talking over one-another during the conversation choice scenes but nothing that would put me off a game. Is this a positive?!. The voice acting seemed OK from the bits I saw. err... 

Not a game for me.","Narrative Clarity, Accessibility, Value for Money"

" This game is great. Lots of fun, easy to get invested. The most valuable parts are with the characters. The characters make the game by making the world believable and interesting. The dialogue is expertly written, and adds a lot of intrigue to an otherwise quite empty game. 

Listen, you can easily put  70+ hours into this game just by investing in the side stories and other missions, but, at the time of writing this at launch, there game is quite empty. The main story is incredibly short, and your choices only matter during the last mission.  All choices you make beforehand do not matter and do not impact your ending whatsoever. However, doing the side missions opens unique opportunities in this last mission. 

For some poor qualities, the NPCs AI is shoddy at best. They're predictable, slow, and not much of a challenge in the later game. The only challenge being pure combat. Enemies will 2-3 shot you depending on your difficulty, but it's easy to lose them and beat them all in stealth.

You have a choice in stealth to kill or knock unconscious your opponent. This choice makes no impact on the story whatsoever and only impacts character dialogue in certain side missions. 

Police in this game are a joke. They will spawn behind you at any given moment, and know about every crime you commit. No matter what you do, if you get a police star, you are forced into combat and they begin spawning behind you. It is easy to lose them. They will not chase you in cop cars and they are easy to just run away from. Not very dynamic.

I make many comparisons to GTA V in this review, which may not be a fair comparison, but even if you look even further back to Skyrim, that game had more value in exploration and enemy AI. Items that you pick up around the world are all but useful. Only weapons and clothing have any value other than crafting schematics. In Skyrim, there were junk items but otherwise there were plenty of important non-weapons and armor you could find such as one-time spells, books, healing items, etc. This game has none of that.

I'll end this review even if this isn't a complete compilation of my experience. The game is good, and you can easily spend lots of time in it. However, this game only receives the thumbs up because I believe in its future. It needs more. I see no reason to replay this game whatsoever. The ending choices are the only ones that matter, so I'll just go back to a previous save and do the last mission again.","Narrative, Content Volume, Technical Stability"
"Dystopian future, Yes",Narrative Setting
"i don't often clock in over 100 hours in a game, let alone this quickly.  having achieved 2/6 endings, there's still a wealth of content I haven't touched yet.

cyberpunk is a deeply flawed game around the edges, but at it's core sits some of the best writing and storytelling I've witnessed in video games.  if you're a sucker for storytelling, this wont let you down.

the combat ranges from functional to forgettable.  I found it to be incredibly clunky at first, but as the game progressed I grew more used to it.  I personally went in guns blazing, maxing body, handguns, and blades.  While the combat was enjoyable, my first firefight felt no different from the last one.  having a more in depth crafting system and weapon modification system would help solve this, as the current system only allows for adding scopes/silencers and a few stat amplifiers; I never felt like I had a special attachment to any of my weaponry and would swap out a gun at a moments notice if I stumbled across one with a higher DPS.  

And yet, I still found the gameplay loop to be enjoyable, as the constant switching of my loadout kept things somewhat fresh.  There are multiple ways to handle a situation, and I imagine most of my views on the combat system are due to my reluctance to try out the hacking/stealth style of gameplay until the endgame, which I found equally serviceable.  As the game continues to be patched and modders sink their teeth into this I could see myself starting a new game as a non-lethal build.  time will tell.

addressing the current state of the game (as of December 2020), it's very evident playing that mass amounts of content had to be cut from the game.  but with what the game launched with, I would still say it's worth the price.  bug wise, I only had one consistent and major bug - plants.  if a tree, bush, or flower was in render distance I would see it through walls, hills, and characters.  while this bug was relatively minor in Night city, exploring the foliage ridden wasteland outside the city was near impossible, as my screen would often be caked in half rendered scenery from 200 ft away, making spotting enemies near impossible and shattering immersion with missions.  and yet, I still found myself returning to the wasteland despite the damn plants due to the strength of the story.

is cyberpunk's story good?  very much so.
is the combat fun and engaging?  overall, yes, but nothing revolutionary.
is cyberpunk a game that calls for multiple playthroughs?  i don't know yet.

I enjoyed my time in Night City, I'm comfortable leaving this write up at that.  At the AAA price of $59.99, I'd say it's worth it.

Tips for preformance and enhancing the experience:

I recommend editing your inputContexts.xml and inputUserMappings.xml files in
Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config

Line 905,906 of inputContexts.xml you can change the speed of crating and disassembling items to 0.1, wow does that make a huge difference, now I can craft 30 grenades in no time.

Also by using the Cyber Engine Tweaks (/mods/107/  on NexusMods) I was able to get another 10-15fps.","Narrative Appeal, Technical Performance, Gameplay Enjoyment"
"It's infested with bugs, like right now i am running around buck naked, cause i lost all my clothes?
Sometimes i got hair mostly bald when looking in mirrors. Driving first person is wonky and unless you tweak controller it's wonky third person too. BUT, it has huge possibilities and when they fix this it will be a very good game and if they do it right replay value will be high. I do not regret the pre-purchase, And if it is like their other games it has high chance of being fixed and improved. This is an adult game! My laptop is just a step above (GTX1650) ps4 and xbox, and it shows in framerates. Still figuring out settings that keep the look but make it more playable, Oh did i say the melee combat is wonky too? LOL Oh get smart weapons as fast as you can, aiming and shooting is (can you guess it?) wonky too. Can be what they said it could be but expect that to happen next year.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Mechanics, Consumer Value"

This game as a good story line, great cast of voice actors and amazing scenes.

"TLDR :-
I don’t recommend the game right now. It’s too lackluster for what it’s worth. Leaving aside the buggy game, the game on its own is too stale.

Full review: -
What I dislike
1) how lackluster and how the choices made does not influence anything in the game story. I could be a bad guy on one side story and a good guy on another side story and we’ll still get the same ending. The ending is only dependent on the final missions. 

2) The open world seems full but it’s actually insanely empty. All mini side quests such as NCPD are generally the same. Run towards the NCPD assault area, kill everyone and collect the evidence. You do that for another 150 times. It’s the same thing.

3) Armor equipment feel irrelevant as any people will kill you instantly (in super hard). The power level of a weapons is insanely disproportionate. 

4) Some achievement is not doable if you made the wrong choice. You cannot reset the game or play new game plus. In addition to having leveling cap.

5) Open world but you cannot own a house, customize your own character or even your own car.

6) You cannot even take photo from an aerial view despite the beautiful scenery. 

7) The AI in the game is so bad. The police does not react but instead just teleport to you and just shoot you.

8) The obvious buggy game.

What I like: -

1) The scenery. The game despite the buggy run, does come with fine detailed in their design.
2) The music. 
3) Despite having a stale action side story, most of the side story are pretty well-written.","Narrative Choices, Open World Content, Combat Balance"

"After watching the Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime I really wanted to go back and replay the game from start to finish again. And boy am I glad I did. The game is a lot less buggy [although I've never had very many bug encounters in the game when I've played fortunately]. And there are a lot more mods to add more fun to the game, like gameplay tweaks, new cyberware or weapon/cyberware reworks. Or even new outfits and the like. I'm super glad I went back to play the game again because I'm having an absolute blast!

One think I would like to mention, is even upon release, I never thought this was a bad game. I think a lot of people were let down because the game wasn't what they were expecting in missing content and in overall general genre of the game. Honestly, one of my favorite games and I can't wait for the Phantom Liberty DLC, really hoping it will add a good amount of new content!","Technical Stability, Mod Enhancements, Replay Value"

"TL;DR: Nothing short of adding tons of content like vehicle customization, more and/or better cosmetic character customization, combat reworks/build viability, and more interesting side missions would make me want to recommend this game to anyone at it's current price of $60. Since the above would entail a heavy development cost or dlc it's safe to say that it won't be coming. There are pieces that are great but it's unfinished. [b]Don't announce your game until it's as good as something like The Witcher 3[/b]. Don't even get me started on the 40 fps I average with a 1080....

Personally, I think it's too late for this game to make a come back. As some others have stated, the first impression is the one shot you have. It's safe to say that CDPR dropped the ball. I don't realistically see anything short of quite a few patches of free content making this even slightly better. Simply put, there's a stark lack of content and the combat gameplay loop gets old pretty quickly. You're either unloading sixty rounds into an enemy or it's a one-shot kill in terms of gun play. 

The start of the game was amazing. Three very different entrances into the main story line and I had to at least play the first mission for each beginning sequence. Unfortunately once the main portion of the game comes around there is hardly a difference save for the occasional life style speech option which in the end doesn't affect the outcome. Most of the content is shallow. This game suffers from the Ubisoft open world trope of 'there are a million things to do that are all designed to waste my time'. Plentiful side missions that are a few minutes in length to just run around and find.

[b]The big side quests are amazing and I keep seeing myself get sucked into the Nomad story line every playthrough[/b].

The player customization is pretty lackluster. I was hoping to be able to make myself a mini-Adam Smasher if I wanted to and get all chromed up. The extent of your cosmetic character customization after starting the game is being lucky enough to get clothes you like the look of that also have good armor and mod slots. If you want to buy them, the good ones are very expensive. [b]You can buy this $15,000 shirt or get freaking folding swords that pop out of your god damn arms like an alien[/b]. You want this cool freaking car? Yeah well the most expensive car in the game by far [i]can be found in a different color near the beginning of the fucking game[/i]. Save your money for weapons or upgrades. 

The crafting system is unnecessary. You have 50 levels which means 50 attribute points and 50 perk points (not counting the number of them you get for leveling up skills) and I need [i]how many[/i] to make crafting useful for anything past early game?? There isn't enough depth for the crafting system to justify existing. Sure, I can upgrade this unique item to the next rarity but doing that costs resources that are difficult to find and it just gives you an extra mod slot. No extra armor, unless you get lucky with a stat roll. The weapon and clothing mods for the most part are forgettable. 

I'm sure I could keep typing and make this as long as a research paper but it honestly isn't anything that hasn't been said before when talking about the [i]many, many, many[/i] unfinished, messy, and buggy games that have been released before.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Development Readiness"

"This game would have been an amazing work of art if the studio was allowed to finish it before release, sadly this was not the case here but still its a great game. 

I suggest you wait a couple of months to let the studio work out the worst of the bugs within the game through patching. Though it is still a enjoyable exeperiance as is.. but only if you have the patience to reload the game if you hit a gamebreaking bug. 

Pros- 
The world is top notch, a great fictional setting in a world set in the near future with the corporations that run the society.
Voice acting is great even if I wish some of the characters had been given even more lines.. 

Cons-
The game is buggy, estimate is that about 85% of the game was finished upon release and the rest just quickfixes to get it to run. 

Overall 
I would only recommend this for players that have the patience to deal with the bugs but give it some time and if the game is on sale later on it would be a great buy,","Technical Stability, World Building, Voice Acting"
"Great rpg ala the outer worlds and fallout with elements from open world titles like GTA or most notably Ubisoft. 

The best way i can describe this is if Ubisoft tried to make a fallout game. That doesnt do the art or graphics justice but the core game it self ignoring the cinematic and immersive nature of dialog... the core gameplay loop is all very familiar. Its a map game with great writing. It feels like it had the 4 years in development it actually had. 

The 8 year number you see? its when they announced they had rights to the IP and started hiring for it. For an example of this check out IO Interactives latest bond game trailer. 

If you can run it or live with lower than average performance this game is a killer ""next gen"" rpg but dont expect it to be star citizen in a single city like so many others did. Its just another RPG. For me that is enough, skyrim without swords and dragons? great! i dont like medieval stuff anyway. 

NPC's are the biggest con in this game. GTA III esque and its so jarring and sticks out especially after the most recent open world games like RDR2 and even Watch Dogs.","Gameplay Loop, Technical Performance, Art and Narrative"
"Great story, good enough combat and fuckload of small annoying bugs (that are fixable with a savegame reload usually!).

I find the game's story sad in essence, saying why would probably ruin the story for most of the people. You'll probably get why in the end of the game.
Imo, CD Projekt Red tried to make the players read between the lines. All you have seen in the game might become a reality in a near future, me and you might live long enough to see it even.

Won't spoil it any further, game has fuckton of small annoying bugs which are not gamebreaking but are still annoying. 

8/10 - just because of bugs. Oh, and combat is not something spectacular but it serves the purpose.","Narrative, Technical Stability, Combat"

"6/10

They tried too hard to create something that was way out of their capabilties. I wished they had created something smaller instead of an open world so we could get a final product really polished. I believe; only a few districts open like in Deus Ex or vampire Blood line would have been a better choice. 

Low spoiler long review below -
I started the game and had to really push myself to continue playing. I started with nomad only to realize that after 15 minutes of boring story telling  and horrible car driving the ""origin story"" was over. 
Dragon age origin made them short but intense compared to what we get here. I get to meet my new partner and future best friend that is a real cliché, like they tried too hard to give us some gta san andreas feeling. 

When i arrived in the first district is got my second disenchantment. I did all i could not to watch any preview of the game before release and so i was expecting some real dystopic futurist city. Something alike blade runner or the fifth element. What we have is some kind of gta 4 / watch dog blend and a real feeling of emptiness. Felt really odd in what is supposed to be an overcrowded nightmare. It really hurts the feeling of immersion CDP is known for in their games. Deus ex series does it much better here. 

Main quest did not really get better as it forced me from one annoying BFF to another cliché character, an anarchist douchebag i had no other choice but to be tied with.
At this point i decided to leave the main quest side way, and to explore the city, doing jobs as the netrunner i'm supposed to be. 

The game runned well medium setting on my comp (gtx 970 - i5 4460) wich was a pleasant surprise. Loading and saving are real fast. Bugs are present but nothing game breaking. 

Jobs are all well made, giving plenty of choices (gameplay not dialogs) on how to complete them, always having some kind of backstory and i never felt restricted on how to complete them. As a stealth / hacker type, playing on hard the game fet good although you soon become really overpowered taking off any challenge.
Most fun came from side missions, some are really well thought. Also had this nice deus ex moment where game tells you to run for your life but i chose to go back and could save an ally that would have not make it otheriwse. 

This is where i spent my whole time playing, doing jobs and side missions as they came. As much as i had fun playing, the feeling of emptiness never left me. This is more an action adventure game than an rpg. Choices are really few and you never have any kind of effect on the districts no matter how hard you fight crime. At most you change some indiviual life but that's it. Game never reflects your action on the world like you could see in the gothic series or the more recent elex.

I like how some optional secondary missions really helps shaping the main 2 chars i first talked about (the BFF and the douchebag), giving them backstory and making them really more interesting than they first appear. In this aspect the game is well designed and even got some kind of liking for the second wich i would have never thought at first. 
 
Once i completed all gigs and side missions, wich took me over 70 hours, i completed the main quest. Final missions are just like the beginning, action packed more than well crafted. There are really 2 endings in 7 variations. All i did while playing, all the knowledge i accumulated on corps, gangs, powerfull people, all the money (more than 1 mill), all the allies.. all had no impact on  it. The ending i chose still felt emotional and i somehow like it, but it should have been one of many choices based on how you played the game and not be one of the 2 only available whatever you do. 

There is a lot more to be told but that is long enough. I will conclude saying :

Do not play this game expecting some kind of RPG like vampire bloodline or deus ex. Marketing clearly lies without remorse to promote games nowadays and the CDPR that built a reputation of caring for players has clearly taken a hit. This game feels like what fallout 4 is to fallout new vegas. I feel like this game will need a real Enhanced Edition like what they did for the first Witcher if they want people trust again.","Game Scope, Narrative Quality, Gameplay Mechanics"

"Pros: Without doubt the best-looking game I've played, with exceptional character designs, appealing companions, and cinematic storytelling—all supported by stellar voice acting and fluid animations. The flexibility of play styles provides a fun, rewarding experience.

Cons: Halfway through the game, the immersion is fractured by the ease at which the supposedly near-apocalyptic morally ambiguous world becomes too easy to navigate. V, introduced as an underdog, suddenly becomes unstoppable—yet this meteoric rise doesn't translate into meaningful character development by the game's end. While technically stunning, the game's visual identity lacks memorability, oscillating between glossy advertisements with beautiful characters and a bland world design that fails to emotionally reinforce the story's themes. (Though perhaps this emptiness is intentional, reflecting the soulless corporate aesthetic of mindless consumerism and shallow thrills.) The main story's cinematic quality is its primary appeal, though it lacks lasting impact. While the multiple endings for main and side quests offer a refreshing departure from games that chase a single ""perfect"" ending, their moral implications feel hollow. Each path rewards the player regardless of their choices, reducing meaningful decisions to simple preferences—whether about rewards or one's opinion of Keanu Reeves. The endings ultimately fall short of their potential, failing to deliver genuine character growth or meaningfully resolve the moral dilemmas encountered throughout the protagonist's journey.

Conclusion: Cyberpunk 2077 is still a fun game that undoubtedly is worth the sweat and tears of many hardworking, creative individuals which alone I gladly pay for. However, I look forwards to improvements in future games, but right now, I've had enough of Night City.","Visual Design, Narrative Development, Gameplay Balance"
"The Good
 - Looks pretty good
 - 'Cyberpunk' aesthetic executed quite well, although with a 'pop' filter, should be grittier.
 - I've found exploring the city and completing side quests pretty enjoyable despite the legion failures. 

The Bad
 - Pointlessly frequent use of F word, half the time it feels glued in for impact
 - No Angelspit music.  This indie band's early material absolutely fits the aesthetic and deserving of a signal boost.
 - Janky at times. 
 -  Thus far in my playthrough the main plot often unnecessarily nerfs you character and closes them in in scripted environments.  Main plot is at times a terrible game for this reason, then is pretty great again once you're in the city.
 - The quest you get is the quest you do.  I was expecting a Witcher style level of world complexity.  This does not exist.
 - UI is often just bad.  It's often not clear why the target for hacks has been selected - e.g the enemy under the crosshair is ignored despite line of sight, and instead a radio far away and in no way under the crosshair is selected

In short, game needs DLC to fix its tragic simplicity.  This review started positive, but after playing through further the simplicity became more tragic.  Go play the original Deus Ex instead, it has a fleshier world.","Aesthetics, Gameplay, Technical Stability"
"Main story Quest. To be honest, very short, I was expecting more. Side quest, most are interesting but most of it are somewhat repeatable. I can live with the glitch for now. You can have a 100 types of different endings but in the end, player just wants to feel immersive in the game or more stuff to do.","Narrative, Gameplay, Technical Stability"
"After overcoming the bugs and glitches in the launch, this is by far one the best games i've played. The story is immerse, and makes you feel empty after it's finished. As intended, i guess?","Technical Stability, Consumer Value, Narrative"

And the really hidden gems of music like the camp fire guitar songs or on a certain yacht scene, goosebumps. 2020 was the worst year for everyone, but it ended with a delightful piece of art that managed to redeem some of this awful year.

After this review and a post I made raising awareness about the lack of transparency about the launcher requirement, my account was restricted to due to ""disrespectful language"" - well that seals my opinion, I'm done buying CDPR games.

"I never played this game when it initially launched due to the big let down with launch. And about two months ago I started to hear people continue to talk about it and play it, especially with the new DLC that dropped. I decided to purchase the game and actually see what all it was about. Let me tell you, this game has such an amazing story and the options you choose help shape it as you continue. There are so many side missions and things to find in Night City. The weapons are very unique and really cool to shoot. The vehicles handle really nicely and are enjoyable to collect. If you like to have a partner in the game the options are there as well! (Definitely a Panam simp) Overall the game is extremely replayable and has so much to do and with the frequent updates it receives, you'll be playing it a lot.

"tl;dr: spent most of my four hours playing this game trying to fix the settings on my end only to realize that it was hopeless because this game doesn't work. 

Constant fps drops, controller and game lag, etc. Definitely disappointed by company response to being called out for going back on decisions, releasing a buggy game, racism, and transphobia in the game. I was really looking forward to this game but I'm really, really disappointed.","Technical Stability, Developer Accountability, Ethical Content"
AWesome game. Just what I expected!,"Consumer Value, Expectation Fulfillment"
"Some of the best RPG storytelling I have encountered in modern gaming. The voice acting is incredible, and it brings a richness to the plot lines that draw you in. I found that I was ignoring other in game activities because I wanted to pursue the current plot. I look forward to the calls and texts in the game as they provide interesting ways to interact with the world that aren’t based on DPS. It reminds me of Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind where Speachcraft was often more important than combat skills. 
I am also enjoying the skill progression mechanics as well as the crafting and other non-combat related content. I feel the game balances well, and it allows you the freedom to choose your path as much as one could in the circumstances.
The combat itself is good, but I started on Hard which has a pretty steep learning curve. Once I got some decent chrome and skills, it leveled out. 
As far as bugginess, I am only seeing what I would consider the normal amount for a game this complex. I haven’t run into reset or freezes, but you would still be wise to save often as autosaves may not allow you to get out of the jam you put yourself in. Specifically, you can work your way into areas that you can’t get out of requiring a revert to an older save. Again, similar to Morrowind, you had to take care when exploring. 

Overall: Excellent Game. 
I don’t regret buying it, and I would have happily paid full price in retrospect. If the developers add content, I will buy it.

There are no happy endings in night city,Narrative Perspective
"The game is highly appealing to achievers because it offers lots of main and side quests and collectibles that give a sense of accomplishment to the player. It is also intended for explorers since it is an open-world game with a lot of secret locations to discover, and it also has a non-linear story that allows explorer players to choose multiple paths in the story for different experiences and outcomes. Killers would also find the game interesting due to the combat mechanics. It offers a robust combat system with a lot of guns, cyberware abilities, great gunplay, and even katana sword fighting.

The character animation is highly detailed and lifelike. The environment has a lot of neon and vibrant colors. The style is retro-futuristic with high-tech, holographic advertising, and cybernetic themes mixed with low-life visuals. In terms of VFX, there are a lot of explosions, gun fire, and hacking effects. Great environmental effects such as fog, rain, and electric sparks, among others.

The fact that the player can access buildings, rooftops, high-tech corporate offices, access to elevators, etc. gives the sensation of deep exploration in a dynamic city. The levels are designed to have multiple ways to go around. Something that I love is the way the player can interact with the elements in the levels, such as vending machines, computers, police, strangers, etc., which contributes to the feeling of a living world.","Player Type Appeal, Combat Mechanics, Visual Style"
"I'm reasonably sure this is the first review I've ever bothered leaving on Steam. I just finished one of the endings at 49.1 hours and overall I have to give Cyberpunk 10/10. I feel sorry for the all the console players out there but as a PC gamer, I experienced only minor occasional glitches. Absolutely nothing that would entertain asking for money back on this masterpiece. I'm the type of gamer that only plays games for their story and this one knocks it out of the park! As for frame rates, I guess I didn't even look. After the opening scene, I reduced my resolution from 4k ultra to 2k ultra and never experienced so much as a single screen tear after that. Smooth as butter. I really liked this game and truly hope all the console reviews don't tank it to the point of cancelling all DLC. Thank you CD Projekt Red!","Narrative, Technical Stability, Consumer Value"
"There are some bugs, yes, nothing game braking yet. The performance is okay, but really it's actually good when considering how great everything looks in mid settings.

The RPG elements are pretty standard, I have no complaints. The storytelling and world building, overall feel and tone of the game, there's nothing like it. It's on a completely different level to most games. And I've only just come out of the prologue. 

I feel like, bar the bugs and undoubtedly that has ruined some peoples' experience, you have to be on some kind of a hate trip to try and deny the game is great. So, even though I wouldn't like to review this yet, I feel like I have to recommend the game at this point to counteract the hate.","Technical Stability, Narrative Quality, Consumer Recommendation"

It is buggy sometimes yes I haven't had anything big or major, Just a few frozen characters sliding around for 4 seconds. But trust me! It's worth the buy you will play it and fall in love with characters and feel connected and sad and angry all at the same time like V. So personally would recommend.

"It's an okay game, if your standards are not too high. I kinda enjoyed most of the game, but it IS an unfinished product, and will be for a long time (at least until the first DLC).

I'm giving it a low score because CDPR disrespected it's own history and all of its faithful customers launching a game, that they themselves built so much hype over, in an ""Early Access"" state, using all players as beta testers, and to add insult to injury to everyone who bought it in pre-sale, two weeks after the train wreckage of a release, they cut the price in half.","Technical Stability, Consumer Value, Developer Accountability"

It DID NOT come together. It has so much good, but yet... its like trying to eat ice cream with your hands; it tastes great but it gets less appealing as you go and slips through your fingers before you can finish it...

*Note: I do not recommend eating ice cream with your hands*[/i]

It's my fault for wanting to do lots of stuff; maybe I overplayed to the point it overstayed its welcome; maybe all the endings I tried left a sour taste in my mouth and felt rushed. In anycase I have no real interest in coming back to this; good world/design, meh game/story. I'll leave the thumbs up, but man I wish there was middle option...

Edit Aug 29, 2023
SO As you can see, I've played this a lot, and tbh I have ignored the main story and just messed around a lot to the point I am ridiculously OP...

Anyways, this is not a bad game, it is amazingly pretty (turn on rt reflections but turn off the other ray trace options, it looks amazing and doesn't destroy your card) I can say its very solid, like a 8-8.5 overall, but sometimes the quality shoots through the roof... other times meh writing or just outright bugs or bad scripting hinders the experience. It's about what I expected to get... 2.5 years later :/

Maybe the DLC will be amazing like Blood and Wine was for W3...

Really good game, Don't listen to the salty people cause they have a poopy pc that they haven't upgraded in 5 years.

Maybe think about upgrading ur pc before playing a next gen game LOL???

Anyway honestly a solid 9/10 - Buggy? yes of course but they're just funny and stupid, I would say if you like roleplaying and tryna become popular because you cant in real life play this game and make like 100 friends, do there dirty work and make bank. If you're a horny gamer you can run around with ur boobies outs, because in night city nobody cares!

Just buy it and play it ignore the console shit..... ur on pc for god sake

-if you're having audio crackling issues, go to your sound settings, find your audio device, right click it and go to properties, go to the advanced tab and change your default format to 24 bit 44100 HZ or lower. I had to do this through the focusrite program but it achieved the same thing and completely eliminated all audio crackle.-

Already run into a few bugs from AI, loot i couldn't pick up, objects disappearing etc, but overall the game feels nice to play so far. 

Performance could probably be a bit better going by feedback from others, but on an RTX 3090 + i7 7820x with 32gb ram, i'm getting 70-90fps on ultra settings with ultra raytracing and balanced DLSS @ 3440x1440, none of the dynamic fidelity stuff turned on, so i don't reaaallllly have too many complaints about performance.

Can see a lot of inspiration from The Witcher 3 in some of the ways things are done in this game, chances are if you wanted the game, you'd already have it and have been waiting for at least a few years for it though, so can't really say much other than enjoy it :)","Technical Stability, Performance, Audio Troubleshooting"
"Of all the games I could have EVER Played, i am so glad i could live in a generation to experience THIS one.
Cyberpunk 2077, and it's expansion DLC: Phantom Liberty, were life-changing experiences for me. I am a player that bought the game during its earlier years, at around the 1.2 update. I played the game during covid simply because i had nothing better to do and i was getting tired of reruns of RDR2 (though i love that game also)
Every single experience ive had in this game, has been funny, charming, tedious at times during earlier years and outright emotional in most cases. From how i played this game at a couple months post-launch, to Post-Phantom liberty, i have seen a massive change in my relationship to this game, and how i view it. And i came to grow an appretiation and downright adoration for every single reference, detail, mechanic, bug (sometimes), character, place and setting i've seen in this game, Night city is geographically a perfect size for any player new or old, and makes use of its wonderful command in colour, ambience, and roleplaying opportunities to create a custom tailored experience for every and any player looking to make their worth in Night city. And its every journey you take, from NCPD Side hustles, to side quests of a guy who cons you out of a couple bucks, to the botched heist of a lifetime. You see something fresh and new.
Phantom Liberty expands upon those same elements and turns them up to a WHOPPING Eleven! virtually every quest you do, every mission you go on, is thought out and executed by your actions alone, and should serve as a testament to all writing pieces on how to morally challenge a person, and see how far theyre willing to go for their individual desires and needs. and for each choice you make, their will always be a con. If cyberpunk had launched at this state its at now. i feel as if i'd have walked into a new world entirely... however, staying along for the journey, from buggy gigs and poor skill tree designs, to an anime that saved and rekindled the love and flame everyone had for this franchise. and to this. a climactic, ambiguous and heartbreaking finale that leaves more questions than answers, but at the same time, fulfills your every desire and expectation from a game that had so much hype initially. it may not have been perfect, but the journey that led to its destination... is its own perfection. i implore anyone, to play this game. with the Added DLC. make your own way through this story, and your own decisions.. and when you leave, you may just be a changed person","Personal Value, Game Evolution, Emotional Impact"
CANT STOP PLAYING IT RALLY FUN,"Addictiveness, Fun Factor"
"[h3] This game, in the state that it currently is in, is the most immersive game I have ever played, bar none. [/h3]

I don't know why specifically, but this game just [i]clicks[/i] with me.

I've done several playthroughs at this point, with another ~150 hours on console as well. Every single time, I discover new details, new options, new characters, new items, new lore, new paths through scenarios, new locations, new dialogue, on and on.

[b]The one caveat I have to give,[/b] is that this game is very tempting to play like a looter-shooter. And sure, it is a lot of fun to do that, as the combat is excellent and the abilities are a blast. But I have found that getting into the [u]roleplaying[/u] aspect of this game takes it [i]SO[/i] far beyond that experience. 

[i]Cyberpunk[/i] makes it extremely easy to get completely lost in the world, events, and your character, and I highly encourage you to do so for, in my opinion, the best experience of this game. Shorter playthroughs where you don't do EVERY sidequest and only choose the ones your version of V would actually accept not only help the pacing of the game, but also allow for a totally different experience on subsequent playthroughs.

It is hard to condense everything there is to say into a short review, but I will suffice to say that if you even vaguely enjoy any open world games, the cyberpunk genre, first person shooters, immersive worlds, or story driven content, this game will blow your mind. If it's not your flavor, hey, it's not for everyone. But if you're still on board by the end of the first act, [b]  you [i]gooooottaa [/i] buy the DLC.

There have been many times that I've sat and watched the credits roll after a great game. That bittersweet feeling of the conclusion to a fantastic campaign as the names scroll up for a few minutes, and I get to think about the highlights of the game before I go on with my day. Maybe a couple chills down the spine, maybe a tear or two for a heartbreaker ending, maybe a pop-off for beating the toughest difficulty. But this game is the first time I've ever had to just sit in a stupor and reflect on my life for literal hours, long past when the credits stopped rolling.

Edit: its been a while now, CDPR has been working pretty hard on fixing this game and I appreciate it. Not just bug fixes but noticeable quality of life changes. For example, the map used to have all side missions available to view even if you hadn't visited that part of the map or you weren't high enough level, but now everything is discover able by going to it and they only show missions that are the right level.

"(+) Combat feels good
(+) Main quest is interesting

(-) Dead lifeless citizens
(-) Some side quests feel like you have to read text messages on your phone to understand their story.
(-) People and objects turn into weird block textures until they load up.
(-) A number of bugs. For one, I double jumped in one of the main quests and was outside of the known world and had to reload.
(-) While it makes sense that people are shooting at you drop their guns, I feel compelled to pick them all up because I'm a hoarder. A lot of the game you spend at the little selling booths dumping excess. I wouldn't mind a button where it's not only sell all junk, but sell all gray quality/green quality gear floating in your inventory unequipped. 

While I had more negative points than positive, I'm still having fun with the game overall. The combat being fun and the main story being interesting is more important to me than weird glitchy stuff.

"Pro:
- RTX makes it truly next-gen.

- Stupid AI
- Movement feels stiff and not consistent.
- FPS is not consistent. 60-90 FPS for 3080 is not ideal
- In some gig mission, when you completed the bonus. You cannot interact with the access point to retrieve the reward.
- Random fall throughout the map.
- There is a unfinished wall in an alley where you could see through the wall and even walk inside.

I've played the game again, game feels so much better now. Yes there's some minor bugs but they're mostly visual(and happen not very often). I think my first review was wrong, I really like this game. Gameplay is amazing, story even better. If you're thinking of buying it - if you're having good pc, get it right now. money-satisfaction ratio in this game is really high.

Thanks CD Projekt RED for making this game.

2.0/2.01 patch update.

When I first heard about the DLC back in november 2022 I think, I was so excited for it that I decided to play Cyberpunk again and make it platinum. Little I knew that DLC is coming almost year later. But I still had lots of fun just roaming, doing all the gigs etc. 
Now we have DLC and it is amazing. I love everything about it. Story is amazing,reworked skills(they added new skill tree and perks too!) new district (which is like 1/8 of the whole map feels like its atleast 1/2 of the map) and a lot of upgrades to the game. They added some cool details like you can pop tires now! You can also shoot from the car, bike and some of them are heavy armed with machine guns and rockets!
I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I will not talk about the story apart from the fact that it is amazing.
 Should you buy it?
 If you enjoyed Cyberpunk - definitely.
 If it's your first time with Cyberpunk and you're wondering if you should buy it - get it right now. It's the best single player game since Witcher 3.

They are just bullet sponges and that annoys me quite much, I want to be able to kill someone with 1 bullet to the brain, not 20. 

[h1]Spawning enemies and NPCs out of nowhere.[/h1]
you can literally see them spawn in front of you, or the room next to you while in combat (when that's not possible). 

[h1]Dumb oblivious AI[/h1]
just standing with their backs towards you while others around them are fighting you in front of their eyes. 

[h1]Minimap.[/h1]
It is way too small while driving, I have missed so many turns because I can't watch the road and minimap at the same time. 

[h1]No 3rd person.[/h1]
I know this is a topic that is covered a lot. But I'm going to be honest, I can't enjoy an RPG game if I can't see my badass character all the time. even in the cutscenes/conversations, I would like to see my character's face while he/she is talking back. 
Only in the fighting scenes, I like to be in the first person to aim down the sights. 
There is a lot of debate about the immersion you get while playing first-person, well to be quite honest, I don't feel immersed at all. If you watch a movie you also see the characters, even the main ones. and I bet we can all get immersed in those. For some reason, I am also smaller than every single NPC in the game (maybe because I picked female, IDK). the FOV also seems to get smaller in conversations. 
So please make this an option to play in 3rd person, or someone make a mod that allows this.

[h1]The lack of freedom in the game[/h1]
This is an open world. Yet it doesn't feel that way (however I can't quite lay my finger on why it doesn't, maybe ill update in the future). 

[h1]Character creation[/h1]
CC is quite dull IMO, Can't adjust weight, Height, only 3 fixed t*t sizes. I need sliders, not fixed presets. 

[h1]Adult Content[/h1]
For a game that boasted a lot about adult content, it lacks there as well IMO. you see a couple of t*ts and a D*ck in character creation, and the same s*x scene with different NPC's, no matter what gender they are.

"TLDR: 
The game in its current state is still fairly buggy in terms of AI, textures and minor quests; But its charm, style and action is still enough to make it a good game to pick up.

Overall this game is worth the 60$ pick up. Beginning with character customization, the choices are fairly lax, but that's expected for an action game like this. It is weird however that there is only one VA for each sex, meaning that if you chose an ethnicity that dosen't have a similar speech pattern to the VA's, it's going to seem off (much more noticable for the male character). Once in the game - make sure your drivers are up to date. Random flares, strobes and out of place textures will be apparent. The updates help tremendously, but are still visible if you look for them. AI also seems to have a difficult time in their death/sitting animations where once they are killed, they will 'pop' to other parts of the environment without warning. Lesser issues include the lack of understanding of the lingo (which will be remedied after time), strangely complicated yet simple lvl/perk system, and weird fluctuations in difficulty across the map. With all that said, it is still a good game - the story is interesting, characters are well developed, graphics are top notch and it gives you the freedom to do what you want after Act 1 (GTA style). Overall, still a good pickup if you're even remotely interested.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Character Customization"

I mean yeah, there's ALOT of stuff that needs improving...but omg the beautiful city--especially at night, the badlands, the storyline(so far I know they will be adding more soon but for where it's at now its pretty alright), the characters and how you can connect with them is pretty dope as well. Don't see how anyone can say that this game is lifeless because I just don't see it at all. I've played 200+ hours and i'm still finding new secrets and things that I haven't seen before. I don't know if people just expected another GTA(because that's all people compare it to for some reason) or what but I'll tell you this game exceeds GTA's storyline by a longshot(can't say anything about multiplayer because, you know). I already know imma get crap for just saying that I like the game-- and that's cool and all. But once they get this game sorted out, it will probably surpass the best open world games out there to date, in my opinion.

This game is no where near perfect, but to just flat out say that it's garbage(and i mean just straight up TRASHING the game like it's just the worst thing to ever hit the planet) just because the internet is saying it is just weird to me.

Side note some of the glitches were funny asf ngl and played kinda well into the relic malfunction thing.","Technical Stability, Gameplay Engagement, Hype Expectations"
"Game isn't bad, it can actually be quite fun and you can get involved in the story at some points. The main problem is in all the missing features (vehicle & character customization, in-depth hacking, additional mobility etc) that were promised and/or appeared in the demos. This paired with the 7 year waiting period and the insane hype that was created through marketing and some fake promises ended up in the game being published too early after being already delayed. It's full of (mostly) visual glitches and from time to time game breaking ones.

Overall the game isn't but most probably not worth the full price and surely doesn't live up to the expectations.

If not, this isn't worth it.","Feature Completeness, Technical Stability, Consumer Value"

The game was over-hyped and promised to play good on last gen nearly decade old consoles, which was a terrible illusion for some to say the least. This game wouldn't play on 8-10 year old PC hardware, WHY on Earth would someone expect it to play on last gen PS4 or Xbox. I mean i guess it kinda did, so that's a win. They made promises they shouldn't have was the problem imo.
Graphics are good, story line is awesome. There are some, bugs but that's almost a given(sadly) in the last 10-15 years on launch day. So far having a blast. Runs good and smooth but I do have the HW for it. Ryzen 5800x, Radeon RX6800, 32GB ram, game on NVMe drive etc. mileage will obviously vary. 

Biggest letdown is not having ray tracing capability on launch. I left Nvidia 20xx series and got a RX6800, which is an upgrade but i need my ray tracing back please lol.

"This game was sold/marketed as wanting to be highly immersive. One way to break a players immersion is to encounter a situation that doesn't make sense in the world the game is set in. There have been 2 immersion breaking problems for me.

1. There was a audio bug I had that broke immersion by creating a bit of static, and then making all voices sound a bit electronic. Now the in game phone adds an electronic filter to voices but that makes sense, so not immersion breaking. But for a character 3 feet away to sound like your on the phone with them, that breaks immersion for me. If it was just this bug I would have just waited until it was fixed to play it again.

2. During the prologue mission, you have to rescue a kidnapped woman. You find her naked in an ice filled bath tub with another body, or at least if you played on release day you find her naked, the day after release day there was an update, that made her and the other body be wearing underwear. There is another mission later on where you have to rescue a character from a group of people who record and sell snuff films. During that mission you come across a number of dead bodies that have been stripped down to their underwear. It makes no sense that the people who made snuff would go to the effort to PARTIALLY strip their victims when they are done with them. They either wouldn't make the effort, or they would go all the way. Yesterday CDPR said on their forums that this is NOT A BUG, but is working as intended. TL:DR CDPR made a design change after launch, said nothing about it for 4-5 days, when most players on steam would no longer qualify for refunds, and probably only said anything because they were getting thousands of bug reports about it, and their developers didn't want to have to keep reading the bug reports.

I am going to ask steam for a refund over this, and steam needs to allow people to get refunds even if they played for 60+ hours, because it looks like CDPR was hoping that people would think this was a bug, keep playing and then when it finally came out that it wasn't a bug, would no longer qualify for refunds.","Technical Stability, Narrative Immersion"

"Interesting gameplay and mechanics. Driving around listening to the radio is fun. The theme is a joke though. ""Crime ridden Night City,"" bullshit. Only other crimes you see are pre-placed NPCs bullying eachother. You won't see anything that feels like Night City is the crazy place it was sold as.

NPCs are unrealistically everywhere and only serve as a way to summon the police via manslaughter, or cripple your video card. It actually reduces immersion, too many NPCs even in areas that should be scarcely populated.

Side quests are all repetitive, like really really repetitive. Game goes quick because all quests are marked on the map. Nothing to do besides quests, no interesting immersive features or mini-games. The main quest line is stupid, heist succeeds but has unintended consequences, spend whole game attempting to overcome consequence. Also, there is only the one main quest line, your decisions offer almost no real variation in outcomes.

"Disclaimer: All in all I've enjoyed my time with this games, there's been a few rare bugs here and there, but for the most part of my 100+ hour single playthrough, the amount of bugs I experienced I can count on one hand, and none were game breaking.

Story wise I felt that they've done a very good job with the main story, the characters feel fleshed out and human, the scope of the story is pretty relatable and the atmosphere had me immersed for days. There were a couple of emotional twists that really caught me off guard and got me invested, though I don't want to spoil what specifically.

Gameplay was solid, guns felt pretty impactful, though I of course chose rifles and pistols mostly, only specking into melee if I needed to for missions. The ammo limits were probably the only thing that got on my nerves especially for rifle and shotgun ammo. I don't like that many missions forced me to go loud when I otherwise wouldn't, but the were thankfully uncommon.

Overall good game, weapon balance can be broken easily with certain perks and legendary grade weapons. Excellent side quests and atmosphere, the game will get better with time, and I don't have much to bash.

I love the game it's amazing & it's lots of fun, so far i have like 56 hours as of this review & i barely did a few main missions, been enjoying myself doing side jobs & gigs (Which i never did in any other game of any type due to anything non main was boring af & felt like a task/grocery run, completely repetitive & boring) they're just so much fun, fully dialogued & immersive, nothing like any other games offers you when it comes to side stuff, legit it feels like you're doing main game stuff while you're not.

That being said, yes this game has it's kinks & features we all wish were in there or better then they are (such things however can be fixed/imrpoved/added), but the core game is amazing & that's one thing you can't fix if it's crap, so all the bugs & issues it has atm or lacking/bad features however can be fixed in due time.

So all in all, in my personal opinion game is worth it, if you're not a patient person then all i can say is straight up RIP, you should invest in your patience skill cuz it's worth it for this game, however i'd say wait a while before buying the game if you're not patient, as the only thing you'll end up with is lots of anger & complaints, so just wait a while for the game to receive some patches & polishes & buy later on, for anyone else who has the patience and can enjoy the game with bugs you should buy/not refund and simply stay patient like the rest of us & look forward to the amazing product this will be once it's polished out.

(Yes i know this game has far more bugs on it's release then any other game did/should have, but this gabe also shouldn't have been released for a while in my opinion & was rushed to much, but that's what you get when you rush & force for something to release, you wanted it soon/now and you got it, but with that comes the price & bugs/issues it has is said price, so deal with it it's a WIN/LOSE situation)","Gameplay Immersion, Side Content Quality, Technical Stability"

It pretends to be an RPG but plays like a looter shooter. The mechanics feel wooden and unnatural. Shooting is unsatisfying, and enemies are just bullet sponges. It still feels like over half of the features they originally promised are missing, and the things they did add are half-hearted jokes. Police? Don’t make me laugh.

Now, the most important thing: the plot. It’s pointless, dumb, and lazily written. The background choice still means nothing. If the developers had any decency, they would have removed it altogether—because right now, it feels like the game is spitting in your face. You should just start as a generic mercenary from the beginning. It wouldn’t change anything, but at least it would spare you some frustration.

Now for the main story: So you kill the CEO of the most powerful company in the world and steal cutting-edge, top-secret, world-changing technology. You survive, stay in the same city (even the same apartment!), use the same name—and nobody is looking for you? Seriously? In one of the story paths, you used to work for them—they should know everything about you. There are dozens of things like that that make no sense.

You have virtually no real choices. The missions are repetitive and linear. Open world is glitchy and lifeless. NPCs are dumb and unconvincing. The dialogue is so lazily written it’s painful. Your character is the biggest douchebag alive, and you can't do anything to change that.

I could go on and on, but the bottom line is this: it’s a very bad game with some really nice art style.","Gameplay Mechanics, RPG Features, Narrative Quality"

I will start out by acknowledging the hard to love parts of the current game.

This game is obviously buggy af. I won't go into detail because I personally have not experienced relatively any game breaking bugs. I had a side mission I could not complete because it would not give me a button prompt to pick up the objective. But that's the only one. The bugs that I have experienced thus far have honestly just been hilarious and have added to the charm of the game for me. 

Now to the good part.

I have honestly fallen in love with this game. 

-The story is pretty great (although there are 1 or 2 obvious plot holes that I identified on my first playthrough) 

-The world sucks you in and makes you just get completely lost in immersion for HOURS 

-I got really attached to the characters too. Every time Panam would call, I would light up like a f@cking tree on Christmans day. I don't even get that attached to girlfriends I've had in real life. But somehow this game had me hooked on ""My"" love life 

-The ending that I chose honestly almost brought me to tears because of how sweet and heartwarming it was 

-The advancement in the game is pretty well thought out too. Although it's not as in depth as what they made it sound in interviews. 

-crafting is pretty rough in the game rn. It takes FOREVER to grind out crafting materials sometimes. Finding decent crafting schematics is also a pain.

-Armor/clothing honestly sucks in my opinion. There needs to be some kind of transmog option so that I can look the way I want to and have decent protection. I spent most of the game with a stat penalty because I didn't want to look like a complete doofus as I played the game.

-Weapons are pretty dope. I wish customization was little more in depth. Maybe add weapon skins or more attatchment variation.","Technical Stability, Narrative Quality, World Immersion"

"Played at launch game ran pretty well, despite all the hate for it. Only really started getting alot of bugs on sidequests about 40hours in to game play. I got burnt out shoving about 70 hours in the game and finishing most big sidequest only having story left to do. I have not yet beaten the game but returning after patch 1.3 I can confirm from the bit I have played since launch it is much smoother. This game to me is really good probably like a 9-10 after fixes (given I have only played like 60-80% of the story from what im told) so not yet completed, but I think the sidequests are usually rewarding based on the interesting narratives and the narrative is what carries cyberpunk. I like combat except for fist combat because sometimes the fights can be lame. only other negatives to me is the police were really bad at launch idk if they fixed that yet. Same with the driving AI if your car was too fast. The police and other racers would literally spawn behind you when you looked away. If that gets fixed or if there is a solution to that this game is easily what I wanted from the game at launch. Some might still be upset though on how they kinda shafted some of the cooler gangs like the voodoo boys.

"Let me just say before anything else, this game has problems without a doubt.

The optimisation of the game overall is relatively poor. I run most games at a solid 100+ fps, and cyberpunk can dip to as low as 30 in more denser areas of the game.

Characters and vehicles often are not fully rendered when approached and the game will take a few extra seconds to fully render them.

Lip syncing works about 80% of the time, and can be a little distracting when it doesn't.

Dialogues often layer on top of one another, so you'll have 2 conversations at once occurring.

A few of the hitboxes around objects are bugged, so that standing inside them will insta-kill you, although this has only happened to me once so far.


With all my gripes about the game said, I can also say that the reason im giving this a positive review, is that the game is fun to play, even past all this. The storey is engaging and the side quests give a lot of volume to the city, making it feel more in depth than just what the main storey can provide, and this is also where i've found most of my enjoyment.

The game is very nice to look at, given you have a decent frame-rate and turn off motion blur.

The driving feels pretty clunky when you start off. Curbs launch you much higher than expected, and turning is slow (unless you brake and accelerate). However as you understand how the cars handle, this can be pretty fun to get around, and if you can't get around that, then the higher quality cars often have better handling, acceleration, and suspension as to be expected and make the driving feel rewarding.

The gunplay is pretty great actually, bullets penetrate object that you'd expect them to, recoil is manage-agable, and gets better the more you understand the recoil pattern. There is a lot of room to specialise in the perk trees, so that if you find you really 'click' with a certain weapon class, you can dump points into it and get great benefits that encourage you to use the playstyle you enjoy the most.


Thats about all i've got, although i would HEAVILY recommend coming back to this game in a few months, hopefully after the game has received some much needed optimisation patches and bug fixes.","Technical Stability, Performance Optimization"

"I really want to like this game, but after waiting 3 years for bugs to be ironed out on PC, I find I am plagued with a horrible audio and FPS drop bug that is so bad, it is unplayable.

The first 28 hours of the game were great (I wished I could play more). However, as soon as I hit my first gig with a Cyberpsycho, it went to crap. I started getting stuttering, crackling, and finally a full freeze . I thought this could have been a standard blip in the system, as nothing presented like this previously, but after restarting, it did not get better. It actually started to get worse.

I was getting drops of 57 with highs to 84 FPS running at 3840 X 2160 resolution with RT on with a RTX 3080 ,i7-10700. After this crash I cannot get my FPS to get over 25 and it tanks to lows of 7, and the sound crunching, crackling, and popping rolls right along with it. I have tried everything to turning all graphics settings to low or off (does not change frame rate), tried lowering my resolution (does not change frame rate), turning RT off (does not change frame rate), and ensuring NVIDIA drivers are updated, and they were. For sound I tried turning on/off every sound setting within the game system, tried lowering sampling rate, exhausted every video and blog link of common fixes, and none are working to even include turning off controller volume and haptic even though I use keyboard and mouse, cause this is a known issue. I also tried using the Realtek inputs instead of  NVIDIA  and...NOTHING!  Uninstalled, reinstalled twice, and removed all residual files manually...started new game, crackling and low FPS before I even get out of the tutorial.  I thought my graphics card might be the issue and ran a benchmark with Superposition and got decent scores on a 4K optimized run with over 100 FPS. The graphically modded Fallout 4 that I played before this game was of no concern either. 

This is so disappointing. I know from many threads that I am not the only one to experience this, but it is so sad, because it was running well and suddenly mid game, out of the blue it is completely unplayable. It is too bad. My only positive at this point is that I did not pay full price, but still over 70 CAD is a lot for a nerfed game.

UPDATE: I got the game running again after searching my computer for all Cyberpunk residual files after uninstall, deleting them, and fresh installed. Played for another 30 hours and bang, major frame drop. This time I tweaked my settings to get anywhere from 80 to over 100 frames during game play and loading screens were way over that. I ran MSI Afterburner to monitor and everything was good, CPU and GPU were performing well, and temps were 71 to 76C. Then suddenly (mid game) again for no reason I am getting 1-25 FPS. I cannot figure this out. I tried loading a previous save, I checked file integrity, I tried switching up DLSS settings and nothing works. I have never had this happen on any game before, and am not even sure I want to uninstall and reinstall again to get this working for a third time.","Technical Stability, Performance"

"This is a game with next-gen graphics and last-gen (or even previous-gen) everything else.  

The bugs aren't even in the top 3 problems this game has. Beneath the pretty graphics it's a very shallow game. The amazing-looking city is just a non-interactive facade - there isn't anything to do in the city besides kill criminals, pick up quests, and buy stuff from the lame shops. 

It is indeed an RPG in the sense that you can spec your character for difference combat styles, but from a gameplay perspective there's not much point because the game is very easy and somewhat unbalanced. The skills are plenty but a lot of them are useless. Vanilla combat gameplay is boring, so I recommend spec-ing into something more exotic just for the cool factor and to spice up battles.
Roleplaying during quests/interactions is there, I guess. The whole ""different starting lifestyles"" thing is basically a scam by CDPR - it makes a difference in the first 20 minutes and afterwards it has a minuscule effect in the game.  
There's a lot of quests, but the majority are the so called side-gigs, which are 90% repetitive trash. The actual side-quests are pretty decent though.

There's a big list of other promised but missing things, but it's been talked enough about those, I can't be bothered repeating.

Here are couple of good things about the game though, off the top of my head:
- The city is breathtaking. It's massive, it looks amazing and it's obviously crafted with lots of love. Sometimes you just want to drive around, jump on rooftops, and explore. There's always a new neighbourhood or street to discover and explore. Double jump parkour is very fun, although there isn't anything to explore up high except cool sights.
- I liked a lot of the characters, they are well made. Keanu actually really surprised me, he fits the role nicely. Female V voice actress is amazing - if you ever decide to play the game, play as female V! There's a lot of great voice acting all around.
- Main quest was also a pleasant surprise. It's a cool story and some of the endings really get to you, especially the bad ones.
- Couple of really good side-quests. Great, even.

It has great writing and a lot of it is appropriate. As of writing this, the game has improved a lot.

"So folks i'm Playing on i7-7700 and GTX 1060 playing on M&K. Simply leading to Graphics set at medium with no DLSS or Ray Tracing. Lowered the setting more that what may be required but i'm getting a wide range of fps fluctuation between 40-245 when keeping it uncapped. The game is not as incredibly optimised or polished as it could've been. And yes it has visual bugs. Cars in cutscenes starting boxy and rendering as the scene moves. Trousers going skin coloured and making my V into a kendall at times. Calls not closing in time. Not being able to pick up items right outside my apartment.

But it's a damn good game. I'm yet to experience most of the supposed best parts of it. And i'd like to complete every mission and get all the content, I also understand that it may lead to some frustrations along the way for me as i might not be able to get to everything due to some random bugs cropping up. Frankly most of the bugs are funnier than irritating. It's easy to disparage the studio for the current state of a game that was anticipated as a generation defining treat. But you have to realise the sheer range of platforms and configurations they have to support, across generations. A driver update between my first and second launch of the game made a whole bunch of difference. More than anything this should tell all the well meaning critics about how the game they've been waiting for is still a little ahead of the hardware and software combo we have. I see the potential for it to be even more amazing than it currently is and not being able to abide by some funny distractions while enjoying something at the zenith of games as we know it makes us more entitled than any of us have the right to be. If you can't even make these concessions, then just treat it as an early access and be glad that you can experience something like this in the making while you play it again and again and again, improving each time you go through a genuine playthrough. With the early access approach you may even come to appreciate the advances better than what you would've if it came out all polished, already having exhausted it's potential of growth.

Coming down to the elements of the game.
> Gun play is simply fun. 
With barely any mods and upgrades or cybernetics one can still enjoy the snappy trigger and fluid movements. you hear a lot about enemies being bullet sponges, well go and play some other games you'll see the range we've been through and if you can see how those mechanics and balances made sense when they happened you'll find no qualms with the gunplay. And far as i can tell it's only going to get better as i progress through skills and proficiency.

> Movement is simply fluid 
and feels pretty good even when the fps drops to 40, and that's saying something. Feels better than most modern games. Need to experience more of the game to say anything more on this, but why take my word for it, go experience it for yourself.

> Driving can be better, but ways better than a ton of rpgs
The cars feel a bit loose when taking turns, but gets better when you slow down enough. Seems intentional, may need some calibration or if subsequent patches let it to adapt the driving as it does with weapons it'll be even better. #FeatureRequest.

> NPC Interactions give a decent range of dialogues and reactivity
It's nice to see this range and how these can affect the state of the game. It can be better, but i'm yet to experience the new choices that come with cool points. Randomly generated NPC AI isn't that good, even the models repeat sooner than expected when i run around the map but a simple interactions while walking down the corridors where a gang member was harassing a visiting npc and being able to interrupt them and deal with the situation was something fairly rewarding early on.

> Tutorials can seem too simple
Early on you get combat, stealth and hacking tutorials. They are fairly straightforward and uncomplicated. to me they felt a bit lack-lustre given the build up and the said improvement over it. But it was enough to easily help me take down a machine gun wielding thug surrounded by his lackeys without taking a single hit - with the stealth approach as well as the guns blazing approach after a tactical recon. Seems to me that since the game is supposed to serve a very wide audience and the makers want us to experience things first hand in the game world than in tutorials it was a calculated choice of just giving enough of a tutorial for absolute beginners. Lesson learned, if you pay attention to the tutorial and keep your wits about you it'll click nicely. if you're just going to a be gun/blade toting pleab, you will feel cramped and bogged down with the mechanics but that's entirely on you. It's a brutal world in the night city, you have to deal with it as the NPCs would have to. That being said, i'd love to get a training mode or arcade battle sim where i can play around as one of the pleabs when i want to. #FeatureRequest if anybody is taking them.

In all I've experienced as of now, i'd rate it 8.5/10. (only coz I'm more of a sucker for games like Dragon Age & Mass Effect where you fall in love with or hate the same characters depending on how you are, not sure i see that potential in this yet.)

There's much for me to still explore and the opinions stated above as subject to changes as i experience more of the game. But right now
The game is FUN. 
The world massive 
and the potential for growth, unmeasured but tending higher with each sequence of the game.

Hope you have fun playing it. Would definitely Recommend

I never played it back when it came out and got all the hat. As it stands now i think its an incredible game. The story is excellent and captivating. The game play is super fun. I was sad when it ended.,"Narrative, Gameplay"
"I am loving this game so far. This is same kind of feeling that I had when first time I entered City 17 in Half-life 2. The city is full of activities. There are many people walking around and doing their things. I believe Night City is the main character of the game and developer highlighted that very well. The ads , cars , clothes, foods, guns etc... all are futuristic and how it supposed to be in Cyberpunk genre world. I am ready to spend hundreds of hours into the game and explore each and every inch of the city.

Now few things related to graphics. 

My rig

Intel Core i7 9700F
Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super
16 GB DDR4 2666
ASrock B365M IB-R
ADATA SSD 512 GB
LG 1440p 144Hz 27 inch monitor

As you can see I have decent setup. I am able to run game at 70 FPS at 1440p with all settings on HIGH with Volumatric Cloud and RTX off and DLSS on balanced. Just do what I did.

(1) Make sure you install game on SSD or NVME drive and make sure game is upto date.
(2) Download latest GeForce driver. This is extremely important. Your game will CTD without it
(3) Run game at least once. Go to GeForce Experience and click on ""details"" under Cyberpunk 2077 and click on Optimize. This will set the graphics settings according to your system. This can be base line. From here you can lower or higher the individual settings according to your need.
(4) Go to most populated area in the city and check the FPS (Use MSI Afterburner for it). Remember game should run at least 60 FPS in order consider as playable. But you can play game at 30-40 FPS as well like you would do on most consoles. 

If you are not getting enough FPS. Do following

(1) Turn off RTX if you have that option. 
(2) Set DLSS on balanced if you have that option.
(3) Turn off Volumetric Cloud.
(4) Set Crowd density to Medium or Low. This should not impact Game or its quests. It will be just less people on street. This also should fix few graphical glitches happening here and there.
(5) Adjust any Shadow related settings as per your need.

This will take me to 70-80 FPS on 1440p which is much better then I was hoping when I checked few sites who ran benchmark before game release. I think CDPR improved performance with their patches and I am hopping for them to do more in future. Now I can lower my resolution to 1080p which should give me good performance even with RTX on but I would rather get higher resolution then turning on the RTX. On Witcher 3 , I am getting 80-90 FPS with 1440p with all set at ULTRA. 

Those who has old setup , remember this is very complex game (never seen this much complex game before) with very high graphic demand. So if you are struggling with FPS then It is good time to upgrade the system. When I say complex game in the sense it has lot of objects , animations , light sources , shadows etc in the single frame which require lot of CPU or GPU power to handle it correctly. Please don't blame developer if you are unable to run the game on your old machine. The game requires little bit more hardware then Witcher 3.

Also remember CDPR did big jump from Witcher 3 (Fantasy settings , Third person , Swords and shields, Horses) to Cyberpunk 2077 (Futuristic Cyberpunk setting , First Person, Guns and cars) So you can expect few glitches here and there but I can be sure that CDPR will fix most of these issues with their patches. I don't mind downloading 100 GB of patches if it makes game better.

I will add more of my review here but now it is time to get lost in Night city one more time.","World Immersion, Graphics Performance"

"It is a good game, not a great game, not a bad game. Worth it in a sale.
Story and acting are excellent, atmosphere is great, and combat is fun.
Most of the ""spells"" are fun and none felt completely useless.

However, the crafting, armour/weapon system and perks are a bit of a lackluster. especially the weapon and armour upgrades.
The world is beautiful, but feels often somewhat hollow. 
Some side quests and all miscellaneous jobs get very repetitive quickly.

The game also requires a very beefy PC to run on higher settings.
GTX1070 + 6600K provided stable 60+ fps on medium-low settings.
RTX TITAN + Ryzen 5600X provided stable 100+ fps with everything maxed out. Though drops happened to 40 fps, but GSYNC thankfully negated the stutter. 

Experience excellent story and visuals, and prepare to be bored if you want to complete every minor job. 
Also remember to check your hardware compatibility, as this game is very demanding graphics wise.","Consumer Value, Narrative, Technical Performance"

This has been worth the wait. The gameplay and the characters are fantastic. Night City Rocks. The lore is fantastic, I mean this is a brilliantly put together world that you can literally run jump and murder in.  The  Whatever bugs that are in the game are cosmetic and small ( at least in my personal experience).

"Uhm, this is like revolutionary.",Innovation Perspective
"Warning, this review was made for v1.03 of the game. If developers gonna push some patches I'll update this review ASAP.

EDIT: Updated after 1.61 Edgerunners update

First of all, I'm huge fan of CD Project Red games and know the way they are released. Cyberpunk, like his younger brother The Witcher 3, was released pretty ""raw"". And by ""raw"" I mean really raw. Flying cars, T-posed NPCs, softlocks in story mode and etc, made it, if not the worst, but one of the worst releases, probably in whole game history. But, as time passes, the more and more fixes were released. And after almost 2 years of ""after-development"", it's in the state, where players can finally enjoy the game. Also, I need to mention huge base of mod creators, whose huge work has been done to fix or add some features (cyberlimbs / fixing vehicle handling / wall climbing , etc).","Technical Stability, Post-Launch Support, Modding Community"
"Very good game. Not bad as during the launch time, it seems.","Technical Stability, Overall Quality"
"I'm honestly having a lot of fun with Cyberpunk and after as much as I've played there's still content to explore. There was clearly a ton of effort put into the dialogue of the story and the world lore. There's a lot of fun little side quests to find, and I recommend doing them between the main story quests rather than leaving them until you have nothing else to do in the game. There are obviously a lot of issues with the game still, such as bugs and poor optimization overall.. CDPR clearly released this game before it was ready and hopefully we can see improvements in the near future. I hope QOL features will be added, like being able to customize your character's hair/makeup after initial creation or at LEAST a hide helmet button. Overall worth the purchase.","Narrative, Technical Stability, Consumer Value"

"Game's good. Kind of a dream game for me really.
Big fan of the cyberpunk genre, good media is very hard to find.
Got excited for this game in 2013, but kept away from crazed fanatics hyping it up beyond reality.
Very happy with what I got, just about everything I hoped it would be and more. Can't wait to play it for years and years (after exam season is over).

And even if I do get tired of playing it, I can use it as a benchmark for new hardware. It'll be one of those games you boot up and play every time you get a new graphics card to see the game again with higher settings and better performance. Absolutely beautiful

Some technical issues that I'm entirely sure will get fixed in the coming months, but nothing too bad.
I'll write a more detailed review once I finish the main story I guess.","Personal Satisfaction, Replayability, Technical Stability"
This is a pure masterpiece. I'm really grateful to the developers of this game for creating this amazing iimersive story,"Narrative, Immersion"
"Yeah it's pretty good in 2024. Especially with 60+ mods (graphical, gameplay, immersion etc.).

And while even tweaked a bit, it honestly isn't the best game in a few ways, but still has many VERY memorable moments. And can be tons of fun once you learn various ways to complete the combat loop. Great world, art design & atmosphere, incredibly on point soundtrack, & a top tier DLC.

Many character build options. I like the cyberware system, and how armor is mostly tied to it. So your fashion can be whatever you want with virtually no penalty. 

Perks (skills) can be mostly be respecced anywhere, which is neat (say you want to switch from a proficiency in smart weapons, to katanas or something...). Base skill points a bit more work to re-do though, haha. 

And gaining certain bonuses for doing various actions (stealth, hacking, melee etc.) I always liked in games as well.

While subsequent playthroughs in years to come should still be fun, this is a game that has some real magic in your initial one, that's for sure. Among my favorite games I would say.

EDIT: A good 100+ hours into another playthrough a year later. And out of all the people who worked on this game, I feel the writers involved were the ones that worked the hardest. 

Sure, there were many things put directly into it from the existing cyberpunk universe, but there's an amazing amount of connectivity and uniqueness/detail with many places, characters, events etc. that if you pick up on (probably impossible if you're new to it, lol) makes everything feel quite alive. And can give many of your actions more weight to them.

Even though they're less and less these days, nitpicky and/or overall negative reviews of this game are kind of depressing, considering the achievement it is when you put it all together...","Modded Experience, Gameplay Customization, World Atmosphere"

"Now that the main bugs have been more or less sorted, the game is running perfectly. Awesome play for anyone interested.","Technical Stability, Play Recommendation"
"So far I am not having a very good time with Cyberpunk due to an annoying crash to desktop bug after creating your character. So I haven't actually gotten to play the game yet Some seem to have fixed the issue by installing the latest nvidia 460.79 driver, but it hasn't helped me with my 1080ti.  I have also made sure any possible overlay is turned off eg rivatuna - msi afterburner, game mode is off, steam overlay etc. I read that for some using the GoG version of the game and experiencing this crash, they fixed it by disabling the GoG overlay so i've gone through and disabled any I could think of but no dice. Super frustrating after waiting so long for this. I hope it gets fixed soon because right now this sucks, and based on my experience so far  I can't recommend it.

Don't buy this game, and don't buy the next one until they prove they have learned they can't just lie and sell games. It's a very medium game they put out.

Feeling Mixed about this game because from the marketing I was expecting that Night City would be set in a Dystopian type world only to have my expectations to dashed with an almost ordinary pedestrian world with this just being a outright GTA V Clone.

*DO NOT use vehicle explosions to kill enemies unless you like losing out on loot. This bug causes loot that can normally be collected to no longer be able to be picked up, despite the game telling you otherwise.

Use explosives at your own risk, since I am unsure whether or not they also cause the same problem, for it has been a while since I last played, though this problem occured for me even after the most recent update. 
*There are still other bugs that can break immersion in the story, although those were quite rare in my pov
*WHY AM I ONLY ALLOWED TO RESPEC ONCE??????? It frustrated me to no end after 100 hours on my save that I realized that I wanted to respec some of my perk points elsewhere, but I couldn't. Apparently there was a method to do so, but the devs, for whatever reason, patched this out. WHYYY?

I totally recommend this game now if you can get into cyberpunk as a theme at all. This game now works very well on pc even if you have an older pc. It still has minor bugs but that is to be expected somewhat for an open world game. Skyrim and every Ubisoft game has those as well.

I've encountered only 2 T-posing NPCs, as well as two game-breaking bugs that required reloading previous saves and a couple small bugs that were only slight, temporary nuisances.

In my opinion, the sheer amount of stuff to do, the variety of ways to approach quests and side missions, the excellent voice acting, the great music, the absolutely vast and architecturally diverse cityscape to explore, the unexpected surprises and new discoveries, the fantastic graphics, and the decent combat make this all worth it - despite the bugs.

I've only scratched the surface regarding the main quests so I expect to be able to spend many, many more hours enjoying this before I finish it or get bored. It may not be perfect, but it's one of the best games of its type that I've ever played.

"Despite a horrific launch, CD Projekt Red has kept pouring their soul into this game to make it what it is today. The world is alive despite a few minor bugs that can break the immersion, the graphics are obviously some of the best in the market and although ironic considering the companies' practices, the story sure as hell is good. It presents an unforgettable cast that all have their ambitions and experiences. This game keeps the morally ambiguous quests from the Witcher 3 and expands upon them making every side quest memorable. The gameplay is honestly rather fun and varied although it can feel too easy sometimes while other times the enemies are bullet tanks. I really loved this game and although it may not be perfect, it's one of my favourite games. I recommend this to anyone, especially those who loved the Witcher 3.","Technical Stability, Narrative, Gameplay"

"Just as with Witcher 3, by the time I was nearing the end of the Cyberpunk 2077 main story, I couldn't wait to finish it just so that I could play the whole game over again from the beginning. I loved it.

Pros: CDPR, one of my favorite developers. They really put effort and passion into everything. Notice there is no nickel and dime micro transactions in their games. Notice they continue to improve and fix their games and offer free DLC. They are basically the opposite of Electronic Arts.
As you can expect from a CDPR title, the writing/dialogue and voice acting is all spectacular. The world is very immersive and my decisions really feel like they matter. How you speak to people can even radically change the outcome of certain events. There is very little hand holding here, you can fail entire quests and make enemies of whole groups just by being rude.
The gameplay is great. The gunplay is awesome. The cyberware is a nice touch and the depth in which you can upgrade your character really is top notch in terms of role playing.
Speaking of gunplay, the sound effects are very high quality and that is a huge factor in enjoyment for me. The melee system is quite nice as well. While it isn't perfect, it is pretty darn good and I hope to see a first person Witcher like this one day.
Even the vehicle physics are pretty impressive despite being highly arcadey.
The game runs very smooth and is well optimized for how giant this detailed area is. Some may complain of poor performance but the game genuinely requires a strong PC. I initially had to have settings rather low to get decent FPS but after building a new PC, I max out all settings (except DLSS at balanced) and I keep a solid 60 with v-sync enabled. FPS rarely ever dips below 54 or so running at 1440p ultrawide.

Cons: the crafting system is cool and all but upgrading your gear is a bit tedious. As you level up, you have to either acquire new gear to stay on top of things or upgrade your existing stuff which can take enormous amounts of materials in the long run. It is a minor annoyance.
There are still plenty of small bugs, the game is simply too complex to not have them. Nothing game breaking but sometimes immersion breaking though.

EDIT: Thought of a new con however there is an easy workaround for it. Just as with Witcher 3, you start at level 1 and there are areas you can't go...I mean you CAN go there but you'll die easily. I hated that in Witcher 3 because I was supposed to be the hero, the master monster slayer... Same with this game, why is one guy able to shoot me dead in 2 hits whereas another guy with the same gun in a different area can shoot me 20 times and I survive? It's a little immersion breaking. So there is a mod you can get on NexusMods which will make everyone the same level as you are all the time. There are other versions of the mod too but I am LOVING the game even more now that I can go where I want when I want right at the beginning of the game and it's always synced to my level so it poses a decent challenge consistently across the board.","Consumer Value, Narrative Quality, Player Agency"

The game is everything and more than what i wanted/expected from the game and of cause you will run into negative reviews salty about the game not changing their lives in someway which is ridiculous that so many people believed it would.

Cant wait to finish my run as corpo so I can try out the other starting options and thank you CD Project Red for this amazing and immersive experience that I will most definitely remember for the next decades to come.

(EDIT) I have since finished the game and I did encounter more bugs like things looking like their closed when they should be open altough this was minimum and didnt prevent you or the game from still playing as intended, only had 1 cut scene where 1 person who was meant to be carrying a body was invisible but if was brief.

So overall small bugs that will end up getting patched in the future but other than that I would fully recommend buying the game as its just so damn good. Also I have a 1050 ti and was getting around 30-40 frames but i have checked how a 1060 ti works with the game and i would only recommend getting the game if you have a 1060 or up unless your fine playing it with 30 frames on low like i was.","Technical Stability, Narrative Quality, Consumer Value"

"Played for almost a day and i must say, one of the most fun and intriguing games I've played in a while. I will admit that the game has shown a few bugs during a game-play, there has been nothing that drops frame or causes something game break, and even still the bugs that i have experienced are completed forgivable, the loot progress has been perfect and that i love the optional decisions and routes you can take, this is in my good books and i will recommend it to anyone that hasn't got it yet.

Update: The potential for this game has gone downhill since i last played, the content is repetitive and there is a drought as there isn't really much to do beside driving and shooting, the characters are bland and the reference are old, i did recommend this in the pass however for the value that it still places itself at, it's not really worth it, if there do plan to do stuff with this in the future then maybe i will be able to give it a positive rating again, until then, it's going in my bad bugs which is a shame, cause as i said before this game ""had"" potential.

Ruined an entire game with the braindance missions.  They are truly some of the stupidest mechanics I've ever seen placed in a video game.  The final straw for me was a string of 3 missions all in a row that had major parts take place using the braindance investigation mechanic.  It baffles me that developers who made The Witcher 3 could even come up with something so stupid.

You absolutely do need raytracing for a cyberpunk game to work.
It does not surprise me that it looks strange on older systems.
On newer Systems (With raytracing) it works just fine. 

Yes, there are Minor glitches. But you can find these in every open-world game. It is just not possible to fix any and all small bits when there are a gazillion permutations in stuff that can happen.
I am shure it will get more and more stable once 1-2 patches are out the door.

"Fun setting and solid combat/stealth mechanics.

The cyber mods are a great bit of power progression and allow you to make meaningful decisions to affect how your character plays. The weapons and perk systems pair well with this feature and make combat feel varied and interesting. 

Stealth is handled fairly well in the game. Requiring a good use of patience and quick hacks, you feel like some sort of action movie spy breaking into hideouts and neutralizing targets. Stealth is definitely optimal for most missions, but you still have the option of fighting your way out if you can handle the ensuing gun battle. 

Character customization is solid. My only real gripes are the lack of tattoo customization and of customizing body types. The transmog system is solid and intuitive, being a nice quality of life edition.

Game is still buggy, but usually the funny kind. Does kind of take you out of immersive moments when a characters cigarette floats a foot away from their hand.

"This game makes me sad. I went into this game with a certain expectation. We all remember the horrible start it had, all the bugs and glitches, the controversies surrounding the company and the game's management. So I was thinking: ""Hey! You wanted to play this when it came out but decided against it because of all that bullshit. Give them some time to fix it up. So it has been about 8-9 months since the release, things should be better by now. The game is on a discount, €40, might as well grab it and give it a go."" And that is where the shitshow started. Let's start with the bad first, for no real reason other than I have negative emotions towards this game. I'm just gonna list a few things here that annoyed me.

Even after all this time, the game is still full of graphic bugs, something I would have expected to be better after all this time (maybe it is better, and it has been way worse, who knows). So I was looking through the settings to make things more bearable for me and found this ""slow HDD mode"", I though: ""Hey maybe I should enable that and see what happens, maybe my data medium  isn't good enough and this fixes a few things"" ... It did ... but also made a ton of other graphic issues appear.

The fighting: It's not my cup of tea really, I usually don't have a problem with this looter shooter gameplay style where numbers decide who you can fight and who not, event though they don't look any different than any of the other low level grunts you have been killing for hours. But it just felt off for me here. The parts I probably had the most fun with it were when it was disabled while playing Jonny Silverhand in flashbacks and being able to kill with clean headshots. Stealthing and stealth takedowns looks embarrassing and feel weak most of the time.

The main character, is fine ... for the most part, but sometimes I would have wished for a bigger range of dialogue options to play him, because he sometimes (and the way I played him that was out of character) felt like a complete asshole.

The cars feel floaty to drive at best and like an ice level in a platformer at worst. Not helped by the GPS, that seemingly at random switches between bee-line and roads, making navigation more of a hassle than it should be. ALSO, not helped by cars randomly despawning and spawning in again (I'm talking about driving on an empty road and a car spawning RIGHT in my car, creating an awkward crash that bugs me in the ground or high up into the air). This is especially fun when you have to chase someone down, leading to crashes you had no way to avoid. Cars sometimes just stopped working when I drove them. This usually happened around mission areas, so I guess there is a connection to that, this didn't bother me too much at first ... BUT it kept on happening and happening and happening, making me abandon my car sometimes in the middle of the desert and having to walk to the next street to call it again ... NO IM NOT PISSED, WHO THINKS THAT?!! Anyway, one more thing to the cars, the game has GTA syndrome, meaning that it is very inconsistent what you can and can't destroy while driving.

Sex everywhere: You can't go down a single street without seeing some picture with someone posing suggestively. I feel like this entire city is build on sex. There are strip clubs..., bars with strip clubs integrated, erotic stores and places you don't get fucked ... but your brain does. Well it was their vision for the game's art style, so I can't be too mad about it, didn't stop me from getting annoyed by it though.

Character AI forgetting that it has said AI and just stops dead in its path for no real seeable reason.

Quests can be a little broken sometimes. I remember this one quest where you had to pick up a key to open a drawer, it would respawn shortly after picking it up, not updating any quest markers. I later found, searching for a solution on the internet, out that the key wasn't mandatory to pick up to progress, but at that point I had no clue to that circumstance and just assumed the quest was bugged. BUT to be fair, I could complete all the side quests without soft locking at any point... good job game.

Ok, there are probably many more things I could list, but that's the stuff that I was mad enough about to write it into a text document, so I could mention it in this review.

Let's talk about the good. Leading back to my opening statement... This game makes me sad, even while considering all the stuff written up top. The quests stories are good... amazing even. Not just the main plot but also the side quest are memorable, engaging and just great to experience (there are mundane filler quests, that every open world game needs to have it seems like, but they are in my opinion relatively well distinguished from the higher quality stuff). It just makes me sad that these awesome stories are stuck in this technical train wreck of a game. Yeah, thats all the good I wanted to point out.
Let's come to the end here: Should you buy this game?... I can't in my good conscience recommend playing it, everything this game stands for makes me say: ""NO"" The way this game was launched, the way it is now, the €60 PRICE TAG for a game that is broken in so many ways and the message it would send to publishers (yes I know I'm part of the problem here, I guess my good will was exploited)


Anyway thanks for reading and for anyone sticking around this long a little joke for the end:

"Having played the game for a bit now, I can say that it is far from perfect, thought not horrible. Being a avid player of the Cyberpunk roleplaying game prior to this, I came into it with high hopes. I have no prior notions of CD Projekt Red, as I have not played any prior titles they published. So I am not sure of the normal pattern with them. That being said, it feels very bare bones at this moment in time. Most of the skill trees are not viable as they only have a use once or twice and no use in the open world. I was hoping to remake my character from my first time doing the tabletop as a younger person. But without much techy, stuff to do in the open world, it isn't a useful build. 
Customization feels lacking. Not much to do once you finish creating your character and no way to alter them further once you enter the game. I was hoping for extremely wild colors and styles. Instead it feels utterly.. Plain. No real attempts at custom looks relating to cybernetics either. Just some on your face and that is it. What if I wanted to become a fully converted borg? Or a character with cybernetic limbs? It feels like they boasted about customization and then did as little as they could with it.
Vehicles are okay at best. Some handle alright and others feel like you are trying to drive a plane that is wanting to take off. You don't get to customize vehicles at all. Only buy new ones and then summon them through magic basically. Not a big deal, most of the vehicles you can personally own have there own personalities anyhow so it still allows for someone to have a somewhat custom experience. 
What I am hoping they will add in the future is more... Interactive portions to the game world. Beyond the main story line, most things are just ignoring you. No real interactions with the world. You just kind of drive from one point to another doing tasks and objectives and then wait for the next thing to present itself.
I would still recommend this game. It has a good base to pull from and hopefully in time they will add more to this. Perhaps it needed more time in development. I know, I know. It was in development for a long time but perhaps they had more ambitions and just truly not enough time to get it all right. No idea, I wasn't involved in making it. Despite this, it is still one of the few solid cyberpunk adventures you can have in the modern gaming era.

"After few years of patching this game, after 2.0 patch, there is no other game with such juicy, immersive gameplay and first of all - atmosphere pouring out of the screen. I practically don't use fast travel system, because I drive slowly trough the Nigh City in my 911, Silverhand is chilling with me. Looking up, I see a city designed in chaotic beauty - office buildings, monumental blocks, AVs, viaducts, cables. Looking down, I see punks, or maybe nomads, or maybe rich people consumed by consumerism, it depends of district. It's nice to slow down sometimes and to inhale the air of this city.
Gameplay and difficulty level is something you need to try. No excuses.

If people brought this game for what it is now knowing not of the prior hope id imagine once they got past the odd bug or pathing issue they'd enjoyed it a lot more. I followed this game for a short while before release, and waited a year before I got it for myself, and to be quite honest ive really enjoyed it even with the odd bug, is it worth the asking price.. in this stage still with big patches being released probably not but its worth getting on offer especially with the latest patch.

I've been playing this game a lot and the only bugs I've encountered were due to my own hardware limitations. (i.e. Animations not playing/loading when they are supposed to) and in 54 hours the game has only crashed once. The game is very fun and it looks beautiful. The combat is very familiar as I've played Dying Light. The story and characters are intriguing and I felt compelled to complete each questline as it was presented to me.

The minimum requirements are an absolute joke and if you plan on buying this game make sure you have a computer straight from NASA if you want to play above 30 fps. Also, be prepared for a large amount of bugs which survived through the ""day one patch"".

"I held off on playing Cyberpunk 2077 when it first came out because I didn’t want to ruin the experience with all the bugs and issues that everyone was talking about. I waited until after Patch 2.12, and honestly, it was worth it.
The game now feels polished, and those frustrating bugs are a thing of the past. Night City is immersive, the story is gripping, and the visuals are stunning. It’s clear that this game was released way too early back then, but with all the updates and improvements, it has finally become the game it was meant to be.
If, like me, you were hesitant to dive in at launch, now’s the perfect time to experience Cyberpunk 2077 in its best form. It’s easily one of the most enjoyable single-player experiences out there today.","Technical Stability, Narrative, Immersion"

Games like these make me think and that is what I love about games, they open your mind and give you so much to try and understand and I will never get sick of that feeling. GGs","Memorability, Intellectual Engagement"
"What can I even say?

I thoroughly enjoyed the story and gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077. I felt immersed in the roleplay and decision making: there was variety, sincerity, and I had genuine reasons to care about the decisions I was making and how they would impact the rest of the story. I loved the fact that I got to craft V into who I wanted her to be; that the game responded to my morally grey decisions, my slight flexibility depending on the case, or my overall chaotic nature that would make even Maelstrom gangoons shake in their boots.

My major complaint is probably an obvious one: the crashes.

Throughout my entire playthrough, I dealt with crashes. Sometimes every 5-10 minutes, sometimes randomly after about 2 hours, sometimes before I even loaded into the game. Essentially, the only way I could ensure that I got to complete Cyberpunk and it's DLC is by spamming F1 every time the game would let me (and god forbid it crashed during a cutscene or lengthy dialogue (thank you Johnny.)) Considering the fact that I put 105 hours into my first playthrough, you can imagine that I dealt with an obscene amount of quicksaving, crashing, and frustrating treks back through content and missions that I had already completed. By all accounts, my PC should be able to run Cyberpunk. I ran the benchmark, I had the game dictate what it thought my computer SHOULD be able to run, I scrolled dozens of Reddit threads and tried numerous different potential fixes - nothing.

I'll still recommend this game because truth be told, I loved playing it, despite how much the technical issues frustrated me. Maybe there is a fix I didn't find, or maybe my computer truly is just hot wet trash and I am unaware of it, but either way, I know based on the hundreds of other people I found with similar issues that I am not alone in this struggle.

Anyway, buy the game at your own risk, and remember that bombing Arasaka tower might be secretly based (?)","Narrative Immersion, Roleplay Depth, Technical Stability"
"This is a review that was long overdue but i felt it warrants one now. this game had an incredibly rocky launch, everyone is aware of this and i am sure many people, including myself, experienced the amount of bugs and issues this game was plagued with. in fact, right when i started up the game day one, a character gave me a sort of training chip to stick into my neck and play the tutorial. however, i assumed it was supposed to be a ship because instead he shoved a whole pistol into my neck instead. i knew instantly that this was gonna be a bumpy ride. HOWEVER, even with the issues and bug this game had, i would be lying if i said that this game was incredibly fun with its tight gunplay, melee mechanics, and gripping story that kept me in the game. my first playthrough i never finished and stopped somewhat half way as i was usually busy with work.

it wasnt until i saw the cyberpunk edgerunner anime. that show alone was one of the most beautiful shows i ever saw and not only did it baffle me on how great it was, it stoked the fire in me to go back into cyberpunk and replay it all over again. after many updates this game went through, it is now in a incredible( though not perfect) state and i am incredibly in love with it again. 


my recommendation: if you have the time, watch the show first as it is a good sort of pregame before the actual game. the game is amazing on its own but the charm is in both the show and the anime.

"Simply too many issues to recommend, lots of noticeable cut content and poorly thought out systems. Plays like a game released a decade ago with a new shiny paint job. Bugs and tech issues are mostly fixed, but its still just a boring looter shooter slog with a main story quest back bone. Very easy gameplay, even on harder difficulties. 

The updates only highlight the flaws in the gameplay and RPG/FPS/Hacking systems. It still chugs on my system. A year later and It still feels like a unfinished game with a bunch of potential, but so far its been 2 months with no patch as they focus on next gen release. Play something else.

2023 update - Now I have a 4090 vs a 1080ti so RTX is a very nice/now its not chugging. They reworked the RPG Skilltree. People say its now up to snuff but 3 hours into a new play through I was just not impressed. With all the other games to come out in 2023, I would still recommend playing something else.

The game has a really beautiful world and characters, but it's full of bugs.  The AI is one of the worst NPC AI you will find in any modern game. Seriously, GTA IV was more advanced than this game.

"Storywise the game is one of the best . The writing is really damn good. And as of patch  2.0 the gameplay is pretty damn good as well. i had gotten the chance to play through the game long back back when it was on patch 1.2-3 ish. and compared to then its a day and night difference . now the different builds you can have in the game actually changes up your playstyle in a significant way . the only thing i miss from the old version is the silenced revolvers. 

and the dlc improves upon the base game in a lot of ways as well. your choices feel more meaningful throughout. theres more stuff to do . the gigs are way more interesting with fun stories and encounters. the only real problem with the dlc is the fps drops . sometimes it drops to well below 20fps. after the latest patch 2.11 it hasnt ever dropped that low but its gone down to around 25 once in a while. restarting the game seems to fix the fps drops temporarily. in the base game im averaging around 55-60 btw.

the game has been improved a lot compared to launch. the combat is much better. so is the driving. and a lot of the bugs have been fixed. but i still wouldnt call this is a polished game ;)  some side quests still have audio bugs . rn the scanner doesnt seem to scan a good number of dead bodies which im 90% sure wasnt the case before. cars still sometimes spawn falling from the air. the el capitan vehicle stealing missions are currently bugged. no matter what you do a lot them end up failing automatically once you reach a certain distance from the destination. i still cant close the windows in my megabuilding apartment since the romantic hangout. also the radioport seems to stop working for like 2 seconds whenever i start climbing a ladder.

anyway the game is still great and definitley worth playing . the main story missions and 90% of sidequests as well are completely bug free. its got a great story , really good gameplay and phenomenal music. definitely one of the best video game soundtracks ive ever listened to.","Narrative Quality, Gameplay Improvements, Technical Stability"

"Before I will go onto the quality of the game, yes it has a lot of bugs. Yes, some are gamebreaking - but.. am I disappointed? 

Let me tell you something - I waited 8 years for this game, yes I preordered it, the second it was available.

The ""haters"" of the game know nothing.. The Story is amazing, the world is wonderfull, everything I dreamed of.

Are there bugs? Yeah sure there are.. do they influence my experience? Sure. Do I mind? No. Why? Cause I got an amaing story for 60€ - I am 40hours in and am split, I cant wait to finish it and I dont want to finish it!


CDPR, thank you for this game!
Was the 8 year wait worth it? EVERY SECOND!

Do I recommend this game? For fans of CDPR, yes. For fans of Fallout and Elder Scrolls? Yes. For everyone else? Wait till march, then the game should be fixed.

Do I like the game? Hell Yeah 'Choom' ;)

"Alright, this will be a long review. So where do we start? From the beginning would be best. 

I got this game back on release. Was real hopeful even though I heard some real bad stuff about it. 
I got majorly disappointed back then. My gear could barely run it and it all broke apart in several places frequently. It all ran like an already faulty implant installed by a shitty ripperdoc out of the slums of NC. I stopped playing not too far after the first act. And like that it stayed in my Library for years to come. 

As of writing this, CDPR released the 2.0 patch, along with the Phantom Liberty DLC (which I will not cover in this review as I am downloading it while writing this.) 
All I can say is wow. 

My gear is still the same old rusty bucket I had back at release and the game actually runs, and I don't mean runs as in functioning, I mean the game runs, and it looks amazing, even if I don't have everything maxed out.

As for the game itself, it feels immersive cruising the streets of Night City, the world feels alive. People walk the streets, cars drive up and down, criminals doing their thing and hiding in all the corners of the city. There's work to do and loads of Eddies to make for mercs who really want to live out that power fantasy of becoming a chromed out killing machine. 
Weapons to try out of different sorts, skill trees to play around with (and yes you can experiment all you want as the game freely allows you to re-allocate them whenever you want). Implants that you can install, loads of different implants, enabling you to play in whatever way you want. (The Sandevistan is insane though and has carried me for so long I'm part of it and it's part of me).

Hacking machines, taking out Cyberpsychos, Investigating crimes, committing crimes, hell even doing good deeds, figuring out conspiracies. The game has a lot to offer if you let it. 

As for the main story, I was satisfied with the way they put it. I felt it was rather short, but I put 40hrs plus into the game before I even finished it. Although you could probably do faster if you don't suffer from completionism. 

At the end, I was left with a lot of different feelings (I did them all for the sake of wanting to see it). The game really puts the dystopia of a corpo owned world in your face, everything's run by 'em and there's little you can do to resist it. 
But even in this run down world where everything seems so depressing, where the city will eat you up as it doesn't care for your feelings, your situation or where you come from. But even past all that, interacting with the different fixers, mercs, to be friends, adversaries, there is beauty, hope, love, hate and sadness. 
The people of NC come in many forms, chromed out scavs, corpo fanatics, hustlers and Monsters of the human kind.

The game is by no means perfect and I shall make no such claim. 
But it's damned good.

City is amazing. Full of life. Stuff to see and do and obviously inspired by asian cities like Bangkok or Shenzhen mixed with LA / NYC. 
The main chars are great and very likeable. 

The bad:

Combat is super clunky.  You really don't want to go with the main quest line and just walk around. 
people on the street all say hey, hi, do i know you and their AI is super stupid. 

I rate this game a 6.5 or a 7/10 thus far. And thats purely for the city. The story is ace.","World Atmosphere, Gameplay Mechanics, Narrative and Characters"
"Cool game overall. Though even with the dlc you hit the end like a brick wall. The options/decisions could use some fleshing out. The city could use some more fleshing out too. In the beginning its like wow theres so much possibility here, but by the end you end up visiting the same handful of places so many times you start to see just how limited the explorability is.

Also the dlc ending I chose was a frign nightmare, just be warned. 

Needs a new game plus and more content, but had fun with whats there.  (also this isnt my actual playtime, i left the game running during my entire playthrough even when i went to work). I hit 3 separate endings. 

Overall very cool game but i feel like each story/questline could be longer and have more options, and being able to do missions and work on the storyline you chose for your main ending would really be great. Once you hit the end it just cuts you off and sends you back to your last save before your moment of ""no return"" for said ending. 

Gunplay is great, graphics are great, and story and characters are fantastic but the actual questlines for each person , and interactions with them are incredibly basic and limited. 

If they released a couple more dlcs id buy them, just feels like a lot was left undone/ would love to play further, but nothing im interested in is left to do.","World Exploration, Narrative Depth, Replayability"

"Firstly to all the people that bought this game and are complaining because you have a prior gen console or an old graphics card/ cpu all I have to say is; just because you don't have the proper hardware to run the game doesn't mean it's a bad game. Secondly to all the people saying that it's an ""unfinished game"" you're probably the same damn people that where writing death threats to the developers when they delayed it. This game has flaws, but so did Skyrim, GTA V, and ALL OTHER OPEN WORLD GAMES. This is one of the most graphically intensive games that has ever been released and it's absolutely stunning! I have an rtx 2080 and it does chug along a little bit but it's easy to see why. The lighting/ shading/ color schemes are all very complex and crisp. This is the new benchmark that makes you say ""can it run Crysis?"" to now saying ""can it run Cyberpunk?"" The game play is a first person shooter style but it definitely is more of an RPG than anything else, so keep that in mind if  you are considering purchasing this game. It has very intense moments and fantastic character development. The acting is pretty average which isn't awful but if it was a movie it probably would give out any awards to the actors, but the story is riveting! This game is on definitely in my top 5 already but I can see how it's not for everyone. Buy this game if you have the right hardware and you like rpg's with fps elements. Don't buy this game if you are a call of duty player that wants a visceral shooter experience, because this definitely isn't that.","Hardware Requirements, Game Polish, Graphical Fidelity"

"Im glad i waited a long time before playing this.
It was pretty unplayable before apparently, but you wouldnt know it from, how it plays at this time.
There are still some issues. Some options didnt seem to like my specific graphics card and there are rare non game breaking bugs. 

The story is great and i dont want to spoil anything, so i will leave it at that. The english voiceacting is impressive and i recommend the female V over the male one, though male V is still good.

Night City is probably the most impressive city, ive ever seen in a videogame. Every bit feels unique somehow, even if i know logically, that they did reuse assets. Cant really explain it.

The gameplay might be the worst part of the experience, but i hate bullet sponge enemies with a passion and played on hard. If you keep up with gear, they go down quickly, but if you fight enemies above your level, you will artifically do almost no damage, like in the witcher 3. Things like that just destroy my immersion. 
The enemy ai is pretty bad, but serviceable. Fights will look spectacular, especially if you use the slow motion implants and play aggressively. Slicing through an entire squad in slowmo and seeing limbs fly everywhere at the end of it, might not be challenging lategame, but very fun.
Cyberpunk 2077 had a few radical balance patches, but its clear from just looking at the perk tree, that the actual balance is still pretty wonky.

Mods do exist on nexus, but no total conversions or radical overhauls worth mentioning. There are options for tweaking the balance and crafting system though, which is always good. Get a respec mod. Starting a new game takes a long time, even if you skip all the dialogue. I do plan on playing once more from the beginning, but if you are just unsatisfied with how your build plays, respecs save a lot of time. Also some perks can feel detrimental, so trying them out can be a hassle.

Earlier i wrote about not wanting to spoil anything, but i would recommend you to look up the requirement for the secret ending. I played unspoiled and was lucky enough to get it right, but if i hadnt, it wouldve required replaying a huge chunk of of the game. The requirements without spoiling the actual ending: [spoiler]Tell Johnny, that he fucked up with you as well and then give him a second chance. Happens during a sidequest and you can not miss the choice, unless you declined the quest.[/spoiler] If you have done that, just wait a few minutes at the end, when you are presented with your options for tackling the very final mission. Johnny will put forth another ""plan"".
That ending might be the most fitting depending on your V and is most certainly the most badass. It inspired me to write fanfiction for the first time. 

Strongly recommended.","Technical Stability, Narrative, Gameplay"

Love the variety of ways you can play & they feel so much more powerful after watching the anime. You can be a Netrunner that clears a camp without lifting a gun or a Brawler that uses a Sandevistan - freezing time while decimating enemies. 

I think outside of Gigs, Side-Missions & Main Story there's not a whole lot going on in the overworld. The NCPD Scanner missions aren't very challenging/ don't have many enemies & it's not as much of an RPG, in a story-telling sense as some people might like.

Just see the game as another story in Night City & you're along for the ride. Choose your combat path & choose what you say - but it's inevitably going towards one of a few endings. The game is just really cool.","Technical Performance, Gameplay Variety, Narrative & World Design"

"Cyberpunk 2077 is not perfect, but it really is worth the money and is only going to get better with time! From stunning visuals, to deep characters, to quirky sidequests involving AI taxis -- it's obvious that an immense amount of love and care went into this game.

Cyberpunk does have it's issues, but it's not the calamity that so many people make it out to be (at least not on PC). If you're like me and have pretty capable hardware, you won't have most of the issues that the internet is so fond of reiterating. I ran everything at high or ultra settings without ray tracing, and only encountered a few bugs (nothing out of proportion with your average AAA release). If you have lower-mid tier hardware, you might want to wait until CDPR has had a chance to patch things up a bit.

One word of advice -- don't go in expecting Blade Runner. I say this because it happened to me. It's not Blade Runner. It's Cyberpunk. It's literally in the name... If you accept it for what it is, you're going to have a blast!","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Content Quality"
"Well, to be short, it is a good game. And poor writing.
I enjoyed every single minute in Act 2 and 3 and had great time exploring the city. I created my narrative which world allowed. But the ending ruined the fun. 
It is obvious that somehow V should choose a nomad life and nomad ending but I haven't understand why. It doesn't seem natural to me. In the end my corpo V lost it all. All my 60 hours of fun life got into a dumpster :) no life, no girlfriend only fame, I didn’t want to. 

But if the cyberpunk game was meant to be a nomad story... Why it even tried to be cyberpunk and not wasteland?

But far too many of those hours were spent reloading and redoing things I'd already done before because BUGS. LOTS OF BUGS. Not to mention bad AI, weird control schemes that are hard to remap, and poor optimization.

And no matter how much you might think this is an RPG—you do have SOME choice in your character background and personality, but not much—the storyline eventually pushes you in ways you may not have been interested in roleplaying for Plot Reasons.

DO buy this game if you're aware of its flaws yet still intrigued by great world-building and interesting combat mechanics with plenty of side missions to help you ignore the main plot.

DON'T buy this game if you're not prepared to deal with more bugs than a Bethsoft game on launch day, the most hilariously awful vehicle-driving experience ever (an XBOX controller makes it SLIGHTLY more manageable, but you can't remap its controls so a bit hit-or-miss), limited RP choices, and shoehorned-in-despite-your-choices end-of-game outcomes worse than ME3's original endings","Technical Stability, Narrative Freedom, Gameplay Mechanics"

Johnny is probably one of my favourite NPC's i have ever interacted with in any game. He is an absolute bro. Night City is such a beautiful environment to run around in. the combat is simple but feels so good. the music is really good and fits the theme very well. most of the bugs i run into usually give me a laugh and nothing game breaking (only played after 1.5). this game just satisfies the itch of an RPG set in the not so distant future 

now to the problems. while there is a pretty decent customisation system in the game it could definitely be better. thankfully they added in a transmog system in 1.6 because man you ended up wearing some ugly clothes when trying to have good stats. You can tell the game definitely focus more on Fem V than male V just from the clothing alone. the crafting system is so underwhelming its crazy. maxed out crafting my first playthrough just to find there really isnt much to craft. couldnt find a legendary blueprint for my favourite gun (outside iconics) nor for any of the items of clothing i liked. definitely feels like the crafting department got shafted. A more personal problem in that i dont like endings that take you back to previous save before the final mission. It makes me lose all sense of completion after finishing the game.

"To start I never watched the TV show and know little of the

Short answer! Game is good, very linear experience, Empty feeling if you're doing anything but the main story, Story/Characters are great!

The Experience:
Not hating on the game and definitely recommend buying it when on sale!
But was not what I expected going in but the story was the main highlight of it all.
Main gripe with the game was how empty everything felt.. all these shops, buildings and interesting locations I wanted to explore only to be met with ""door is locked"" or being unable to interact with anything..
I even decided to provoke the law and reach max bounty expecting some chaos like GTA but... nothing that exciting.
Everything is just for show and it makes me sad...
Wont bother nit picking the small things since the game as a whole makes up for a lot.
Bug wise ran into a few minor ones to laugh at but something is really off when opening the map/inventory menu and also fell into a soft lock when making a phone call.

Absolutely love the game, sure there are small bugs that gotta be fixed but its nothing game breaking. HOWEVER..... i fucking hate the endings.

I can only pray to any god that will listen that they release a DLC that gives you at least the CHANCE to fix that dead in a few months crap.","Technical Stability, Narrative"
"i bought the game anticipating l/acc propaganda but was instead confronted by contemplation about consciousness, free will vs. determinism, transhumanist ethics, jungian archetypes, and hegelian dialectics. i practically transcended my corporeal form due to the exceptional immersion. i fell in love with the world (despite its hostility) and the characters within it; honestly, i would prefer hegelian seggsbot over reality any day.

we are burdened with the delusion of self-awareness; an accumulation of sensory, experiential, and emotional information programmed with absolute assurance that our existence bears significance, while in reality, we are inconsequential beings. this was my ultimate takeaway from the game. it exceeded my expectations in terms of profundity, although it truly didn't have to. 2077 cp will fill my gaping hole for sure, right??

p.s. i want takemura to be my father.....","Philosophical Themes, Immersion, World-Building"
"With mods and, to be fair, somewhat without, actually, quite a masterpiece.  Not sure about bad reviews other than buggy release.  

Regarding Mods: The Witcher 3 suffered from a similar issue without mods: great yet unfortunately not challenging enough.  Now it's not as bad but to someone who's played Overwatch for years, I found hard mode a touch to easy and read that the game gets easier the further you progress.  Fortunately, there's just the right mods for both problems.  Level Scaling & Balance, Harder Gameplay, Enhanced AI Netrunners, Lifepath Bonuses and Gang/Corp Traits, Better Crowd Behavior.  I'm thrilled to have these mods available for my first playthrough unlike W3, which I completed long before it 'got good'.

The RPG progression elements in the game are superb, some of the best in the genre.  Between gear, cyberware, hacks, attributes and their perk webs, there's not a whole lot more you could ask for.  Tons of builds you could craft, tweak, and roll with.

The Combat (again modded) is excellent.  It rewards positioning (primarily survival) and aim (obviously your damage output). There's a wide enough variety in the look and mechanics of weapons that you're sure to find one or a few that feel right to you.  There's a great variety of 'spells' (hacks) and grenades (which are definitely worth a mention).  It really is the shooter-RPG that should have been done half this good by now: it doesn't let you down on either end of the genre spectrum.

The story is flat out superb.  It's a complex, well-acted, and, at times gripping, plot and this is coming from someone that isn't easily impressed with storylines.  Of course the general outline has many parallels: people don't get that today everything's been done already on a vague level which leads to comments-like ""It's a cheap Altered Carbon ripoff"" and therefore it's the finer-grained details that count.  Mimicry and derivation are artforms in themselves and Cyberpunk 2077 nails it.

The gameworld is great but I don't feel it makes much sense to comment beyond saying it's a beautifully rendered open world since a cityscape may not be everyone's thing.

Mods exist and more people should use them.  Seriously, the combat is fun and engaging as I've already stated, but what some fine tuning does for a game cannot be overstated.  Increasing enemy health makes it so that the player is pressured to deal damage fast and effectively, finding the optimal position and adjusting according to the enemy's.  Reducing level up bonuses and gear scaling keeps the player from becoming an inflated immortal (what's the point of all these tools if you don't have to use them to win).  AI Netrunners Enhanced forces you to respond to a constant stream of hacks (spells) and a real incentive to neutralize the enemy netrunner(s) first.  Lifepath Gang/Corp Bonuses amongst other things makes each npc faction unique to fight against.  An example would be 'The Animals' can't be 'stealth killed' (amongst other bonuses/traits).  This doesn't eliminate the purpose of stealth, there's still bonus damage for getting the drop on someone, but it can drastically change how it feels to take on 'The Animals'.

The game runs better now but not flawlessly. The gameplay is still pretty weak. The leveling/progression systems have somehow lost depth in the latest 2.0 update. You do not role play as a customized Cyberpunk from the year 2077. You are V who is a pre-generated character with a pre-determined story to follow which you can do little to change besides what side quests you choose to complete and which ending you pick. 

I've tried about a dozen times since first completing the game to go through it again and after bouncing off a half dozen times over a few years I'm doing a second playthrough now in 2023 to see the DLC and 2.0 rework. I think this is mainly because the gameplay isn't all that fun, and there aren't enough meaningful choices to make between playthroughs. 

TL;DR Watch Edgerunners. Also, maybe buy the game for like $40 on sale including the DLC. I hope we get another Witcher 3 and not another Cyberpunk 2077 from CDPR, BUT this game is now at least worth playing.","Narrative Quality, Gameplay Mechanics, RPG Progression"

"I think I was one of the few people who bought this game with no expectations whatsoever. I wasn't even planning to buy it before the release, but I decided to give it a try and was extremely disappointed.

The combat is the main aspect that brings this game down. For it to be such a significant part of the game and still be so unimaginably poorly designed is genuinely shocking. I could understand if they tried to go for a new twist on combat that just didn't work out, but that's clearly not the case: the combat is extremely generic and basic, and they still somehow managed to make their rudimentary system feel clunky and horrible to play.

The level to which your decisions influence the course of the game is also much more limited than it seems to be at first glance. I was actually impressed in the beginning at how much seemingly small decisions affected the story, only to realize upon watching other playthroughs that they had no effect whatsoever.

Overall, if you're interested in a (slightly) interactive story, this game may be interesting to try out. However, the combat is so atrocious that there is no way I can recommend this game without an extreme rework.","Combat Mechanics, Decision Influence"

"5 Hours in, I really am enjoying the game. I get other people and consoles are not enjoying the bugs and glitches but, I think I either got lucky, or I'm doing something right. Regardless this is a quick review of what I had experienced.

PROS: 
-Fully sold my-self in the game. I'm personally having a lot of fun. I'm a sucker for an all around great story. 
-The bugs I had we're minor. While doing a machine my car was in the background break-dancing hitting random civilians of NS. Also had one bug of my cock and balls clip through my pants while at the afterlife bar talking to Jackie. 
-I enjoy the combat system. It's tricky but really fun. AND the combat trees are amazing and looks like they scale well. 
- Seems to be a long game. since 5 hours later I finally got a TITLECARD. 
- Game looks flawless for me, I was actually in awe of the first time I got in Night City. (Nomad Player) 


CONS: 
- Bugs are bugs. They are there. You can see them. Smell them. Feel Them. Taste them.. 
- Okay, Picking how you start. I chose Nomad. I was like, hell yeah I gotta be a Renegade riding around the badlands for a few hours before night city. Nope. I get to go through a border check and poke an Iguana that kinda jump scared me. Then BAM 6 months later you're in Night City and the entire hood knows you and wants to box you and sell you guns and you have no clue who they are. I wish we could have not had the 6 months jump and just played it to get to know the NPC's. 
- Driving sucks. But it does get a little better. 
-NPC's seem lifeless. Talking about the ones that roam the city.
- Had a few bugs through a quest where I could just do a save and load it and it's fixed. 


In all, The bugs felt like 11/11/11 bugs. Talking of course about Skyrim. They didn't take away from the game. Shit sometimes they were a great moment of comedic relief. The games is fun try it. I'm only 5 hours at this point but will edit as we go further into the adventure that is Cyberpunk 2077.



EDIT: Game was fun. I just expected the main story line to be a bit longer. Still worth it. CDPR are fixing things so please give the game a chance.

"NO SPOILERS BELOW

The ""decisions"" and ""choices"" you make largely have no impact on the late game - or worse - the game forgets which path you chose and gives you a different closure than you expected. It violates your trust, and takes away your agency by invalidating the ""choices"" you make along the way. Up until the last act of the game, I was prepared to mark this as a ""yes, I recommend..."" However, it becomes abundantly clear how much content was actually removed (just from the story, not talking about anything else) - and how insignificant your impact is up until the final act choices - that's infuriating. 

Story and bugs aside, it's a fun game - but it's not the game we we were sold in the advertisements and marketing and first looks over the last few years. I'm hopeful for the future, but skeptical.

edit: 90 hours in - all story content complete, including all available side missions... There's literally nothing left for me to do in this game.

I wish this game had more RPG elements to it. I wish I could truly define my own character(fallout3). New houses/flats to live in/purchase (skyrim)

"For PC I've had some funny bugs, nothing major or game breaking. Find myself just stopping and looking around this game is so beautiful, there's so much to see and the detail really is amazing. I'm not surprised that older hardware is struggling. The quests, and missions are great, you feel part of the world and you buy into the characters. I'm already looking forward to my second play through as there's so many choices you can make to change how the game flows. Not all good, sneaking is hard, picking up loot is not fluid, the abilities and skills / upgrades is clunky and can feel overwhelming. Driving again is clunky and the AI could be a bit more intuative. The vehicles really could do with some work, for example, windscreen wipers when it's raining, or all the cars having lights on in the dark. Also would love to see real seasons with the weather. But all in all what a great game. When the bugs get ironed out and hopefully more lifelike updates for AI, you could really get lost in this world.","Graphics and Performance, Narrative Engagement, Gameplay Mechanics"

 My character is bald whenever i look in the mirror. In the shadows and in any cut scenes where they show her face.. Really kinda immersion breaking to say the least. She is supposed to have cool purple punker hair! Like cmon guys! What the heck?!

 The game needs more polish. The open world needs to be brought to life. For a game with so much sexual themes in your face it lacks actual sexual things to do. The AI is nothing to rave about. Cops spawn in your face and random thug enemies are not really much of a challenge.  For a game that boasted so highly about customisation and cyber body manipulation, We can't even change our hairstyle, get a tattoo or do our nails. This is not cool. Looks are supposed to be important in Night city. We need more options. 
 
I cannot recommend the game in its current state. Even if the bugs were fixed, The story telling is good but the core of the game is missing way to many fun quality of life options. It could be so much better.  Wait for a sale to pick this up. Hopefully we have more stuff and its better optimised when that time comes.","Technical Stability, Immersion, Customization"

The Character depth is probably the greatest part, you really feel a deep connection to the characters and it makes for such an immersive experience.

"Went into this without expectations. 

Glad I did. I see why people are pissed off with the game but honestly it's a solid title if you see it for what it is, a flawed game, but one that lets you have a lot of fun. I hope they end up adding in missing features if they're reworking it.

Story wise, it feels like they cut 3/4th of the story. It feels like the Johny Silverhand story should have been one of multiple routes to take, but then Keanu was in, so of course they magnified that part. Understandable, but disappointing. 

Gameplay wise, I am loving it, hacking is a lot of fun, sneaking is fun, handguns handle well, but there is too many shotguns IMO.

Crafting seems useless to me, and it still breaks your save as per 1.05. 

The cyberware seems wildly under utilised. I would have preferred to go over the top to the point of being overpowered. Only a charge jump? Why not stack charge jump AND double jump. Mantis arms? why not add an extra pair of those? That would have been awesome.

Bugs. Well, there's bugs. Personally I haven't experienced more than the usual open world game. I hope they patch the weirdness, but I hope they keep the speed boosting glitches. It would be fun to see this in speedruns. Walking on a slope for example will excellerate you massively. If you have a time slowing ability, when you use it and use the dodge forward and jump, you'll shoot into the distance. Glitching is fun though, so I don't mind.

Edit after finishing the game: It definitely got better, but I'm still let down by it. I thought I'd want to immediately start another play through with a different play style, but honestly I might just mess around for a few more hours and uninstall. The story was great, but once that's done you really don't feel the urge to keep playing. There's no gameplay loop, nothing that feels worth grinding towards, the non-main missions are pretty much all the same, zero customization, among other let downs. I'm honestly kind of sad. I didn't get caught up in the hype and honestly had no expectations beyond a good cyberpunk game, but it's clear the crunch to get ~something~ released ruined this project. There's also just so many small things they cut corners on that add up. Water doesn't react to anything, citizens literally do nothing except run away, there's dozens of frustrating UI bugs and things which require changes to improve the quality of life of playing the game. I don't know. I could go on. I guess it's worth the money, and when it's good it's great. But I leave this game feeling bummed. They'll probably fix it, but I honestly think it's too little too late. No Man's Sky became amazing because the way the game is a sandbox they could just keep adding more systems and stuff to do, but with such a narrative story driven game, what's the point in coming back to it? The open world here was almost useless, especially considering how easy it is to fast travel. Whatever. Idk why I'm writing this nobody will read it. I'd recommend the game, but think of it more as a cool linear cyberpunk story, not a true cyberpunk city to explore and be amazed by. Sigh.","Game Completion, Gameplay Loop, Replay Value"

You really do feel part of the groups and families you choose to interact with. I genuinely don't see the quality and richness of this experience being supplanted by something better within the decade. 

The hate this game received at launch was entirely unjustified. I played at launch and it was less buggy than current day Skyrim. I feel like the majority of the complaints came from consoles or people with below minimum spec hardware.  I don't  know anyone who personally experienced any game breaking bugs.

"I've come back to try this game again. Give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did. Cyberpunk 2077 is not the game we were promised. Those E3 trailer are, of course a much better game. The character creation obviously had more, and the story was going to be more cinematic.

However, 2077 is not a bad game. Not anymore. It's a solid 8/10 and that's in a very deep, and harsh sense. It's a must play, even if it's not what it could have been. There are still a few glitches but it's much better than it was. CDPR still has a a lot they need to deliver on and they better do so.

I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do.

First let me say that this is not the game that was advertised. There are way too many aspects of the game that were displayed in the marketing materials that are completely absent from the game. To answer the important question though is yes the story is enjoyable but due to the large number of bugs and graphical issues this game really looses its immersion. I really hope that this game gets the much needed fixes and polishing that it deserves but for now the game is not finished and failed to meet what was promised and I will not be completing this incomplete game as it is.,"Marketing Expectations, Technical Stability, Narrative"

Extremely immersive and deep world. Incredible game that absolutely lives up to the hype.,"Immersion, World Depth, Hype Fulfillment"
"While the history of this game is infamous, the nature of how the game came about is part the reason of how the game should also be played. Its based on a paper based TTRPG and not a JRPG - so part of the experience is how you choose to play. Its far closer to games like GTA than it is Final Fantasy, with a vast open world and a great setting. 

The main story lines lead to 5 different endings and yes, the choices you make only change that path so much. But the vast amount of side quests, sudden instances and achievable achievements is what has entertained me so much. Memories of cruisin' down the beach in Vice City listening to 80s classics has now been joined of screamin' down the main highway on my bike listening to Samurai.

Is it glitchy? Yes, but not so that its unplayable - yet to play a game that didn't act odd at some point.

But what is fun is to play how the character thinks - TTRPGs are all about immersion, and if you immerse yourself in this game you do get rewarded. A streetkid living by codes or an ex-corpo turned renegade out for revenge.. make the ""Open"" part of the world your own narrative and you will have fun.

Plus you get to meet a talking gun.. whats not to like there?","Playstyle Perspective, Content Depth, Technical Stability"

Not using mods. Looking forward to an update &n changing this review.

"After watching how bad this game was when it released, I put it on my ""ignore"" list and forgot it existed until about a month ago when I picked it and the DLC up on sale for 1/2 price. I didn't expect much... my Steam & Epic accounts for full of RPGs that I started and never finished. 

This game is different, though. I've been gaming for 40+ years, and this quickly became my favorite game of all-time. I sank 92 hours into my first run as female Nomad V, beating the DLC and then the main game both on the same day. I'm already 10 hours into my 2nd run (male Corpo V) and I'm amazed at how differently the story is playing out and how many clues I never saw in the first run.

The game itself is beautiful. The music, while 90% of it is not my taste, still fits Night City perfectly. The driving, the fighting, the stealthing, the upgrading, the crafting... the game is perfection. It really takes me back to GTA Vice City, a game I dearly loved in the early 2000s when it came out. I got hundreds out hours out of that, and I can see the same thing happening with this game.","Consumer Value, Narrative Replayability, Aesthetic Atmosphere"
"997.1 hours, over 8 full playthroughs. 48 of 57 achievements. Seven endings. Two deep exploration, completionist playthroughs. I only play on Very Hard now. Effing, fricking, frapping love this game.

With the 2.1 Patch, CP2077/PL officially became a masterpiece. Just think of it... an adventure RPG where it's actually a very, very cool thing to do to get on the virtual mass transit system and ride around the imaginary city for half an hour and just take in the sights. If you'd suggested to people just twenty years ago that today we'd be casually playing with simulations of this complexity and beauty as if they were simple toys, you'd have been laughed down.

I have on the order of 340 hours in Baldur's Gate 3. I am neither surprised nor dismayed that it took Game Of The Year. It's a riotously good RPG game and fully worthy of great praise. Larian sets the bar for making fans happy. But, if I could, I'd vote for Phantom Liberty as GOTY.

"I don't usually play early access games, so I guess I am spared most of the common debilitating bugs that may occur early on in development. This game is easily the most incomplete game I have played to date. The world looks great, but it keeps reminding me that this is a broken product. This is like playing a alpha version of a game that has a complete story.

I hit a bug where I can't equip any of my weapons. So I get into a firefight in a mission, and I can't pull out a gun. I had to solve it myself but finding a mission with a cut scene that finally fixed it.

50% of the time the people speaking in front of me will have duplicated sound, one as if they are standing in front of you, one in your 'headset'. It's very annoying. 

Sometimes as you drive by streets will just explode as cars load into the scene, but they are supped to be burned out. So instead of loading a burned out car, it explodes it a la carte right in front of you, dozens of times. 

You may need to reload because of a bug, sometimes that doesn't help at all, like the gun bug. 

I go back and forth from enjoying myself, to being reminded that this is a mess. I can't recommend a game that shouldn't have been released to the public. We can only hope that these things will be fixed in time, but this game may not be relevant by the time that happens. This game does not touch the quality, polish, or completeness of Red Dead Redemption 2. It is closer to a response to GTAV which is 7 years old. This game has not advanced the genre in anyway. It's pieces of games that we've seen from the last gen, without any innovation. So even if the bugs didn't exist, it still wouldn't receive an A+.","Technical Stability, Game Completeness"

I run the game at 1080p ultra setting at 60fps generally, but the game is not that optimized i'm afraid, performance is completely inconsistent but it's not unplayable. The story is great so far, but I have mostly been doing side quests because the main story is so short, but the side quests are great. The gamplay is pretty good, but the enemies are far to bullet spongy, and in earlier stages of the game it is incredibly frustrating.

"It's really epic, the detail and diversity in this game is an achievement!  I'm taking it slow unlike some others reading everything and checking every corner and it's really immersive all while the game waits on me no problem, it's not rushed as in you can't follow anything that's going on.  

All the mechanics are working great, stealth and hacking is really fun but yea, it's buggy and the AI in the street, not in combat, is cheap like it's going back and forth on the same path when it's not getting terrified because you got withing 5 meters of them with your car while repeating the same catch phrase, same goes for car AI. The bugs are nothing game breaking though and are not ruining my experience though I consider the amount high, mostly positional bugs with characters having them flying or go through objects temporarily.  

The game runs really well even when fps drops to 30 because I set my graphics too high and there's too much action going on, smooth as hell.  I find the balance of the loot pretty good and the levelling also, there's a lot to do and I like that very much, maybe not in terms of free roaming but I haven't been interested in that since GTA3, I like having objectives and don't get really much fun from just going crazy in the streets, haven't even tried yet to go on a rampage.

Epic stuff really, it's been years since I've played a game 10 hours straight, well worth the full price right now as I'm normally the guy who waits years for games to come cheap..!  Don't get turned of by the Mostly Positive rating at launch, half of the bad reviews are people having problems with their own computers or I'm guessing they just want to be the one to make a bad review on an epic game, many hours in sight as I still haven't end the lockdown which is the beginning of the game..!","Immersion and Detail, Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability"

Stealth/Knife Combo is the best DPS, but without retrievable knives it's damn expensive and slow. *Edit* 1.6 Now returns the knife to you - Much better.
In general the game is slow and buggy. The 1.3 patch has slowed frame rates on my PC from 60 to 30 on Ultra.

I don't know if it's caused by me using too many mods. And here's the one who might have the same bug as me, there's one NCPD Scanner in Santo Domingo. I encountered the cowboys that are stuck inside the factory. I tried the teleport method, it didn't work. But I found the solution with a mod, I used [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/9298][b][u]Quickhack through walls from Nexusmods[/u][/b][/url], and the job is complete.

Spending 70+ hours just for the base game by completing main/side story, including undiscovered Side jobs, Gigs, Cyberpsycho, NCPD, and Events, I'm really satisfied. The first time I played the prologue, it gave me goosebumps by just how beautiful all the things are. The city, the view, the NPCs, the ethnicity, the dialogues/voiceover, and those people. They're alive, it feels alive.

Speaking of it, I'd probably say the endings can be good but it can be nothing good nothing bad. Hell, to get the secret ending you need to pick the right choice when with Johnny and make your bond with him around 70%. I also liked how they include some voicemails from the people that V's met or helped. It reminds me the journey. Feel empty after done playing the base game.

"When the game was released, my friends told me clearly it was not finished: the amounts of bugs are huge. So I decided to wait years to buy it and play it. Some friends said many bugs were fixed, but I had a very bad experience. I faced bugs that made me sad and UI made me very confuse in what to do and where to go. I started to lose interest in the game and I did not finish it: what is very hard for me and my life of gaming.

"This game and the anime have made me feel like there's something missing from my life. I know both are cautionary tales of what the future may hold for humanity but getting to explore it for yourself in 2077 and seeing how others navigate it and are  affected by it in edgerunners is an amazing experience. I think they have made me feel a sense of longing, a longing to be something more, to try and make sense of my life and to live a life that no matter when I go, I'm happy with what I've accomplished and who I have around me.

TL;DR: Watch the anime, play the game, it may spark something inside of you :)

",Overall Enjoyment
"*Written as of the 1.05 version of the game. I have played through the story once and currently on a second 100% playthrough*
I enjoy this game, a lot. Yes, it is a bit buggy at times and I need to reload saves from time to time, but that is nothing new in games (Skyrim for example still requires it from time to time to this day, unmodded. Yes I like vanilla Skyrim). I, however, also seem to have lucked out from what I have heard from my friends who have this game. They have run into many bugs and glitches that I have not even seen or would have known about if not for being told about them.

I do not own a RTX card, just running the game on a GTX 1070. Game runs great with minimal frame drops and other nuisances while looking great at 1080p.

So, onto the lists of pros and cons. Reminder, these are my opinions and based on my experience of playing the game:

Pros: 
-Great characters, makes me want to hear them out
-Selection of gear is good
-Great writing, makes me actually want to listen to the story
-Atmosphere is next level, immersive AF
- Looks very nice, attention to detail is very good
-Many things to do
-Overall good time

The middle ground:
-Combat is meh (CDPR not known for great combat, went from ""haha I swing sword and throw magic"" to ""haha I shoot gun and hack your brain""). It is decent enough to not be boring
-Cars seem to be a ""do I want to walk or do I want to go find a road and call my car"" kind of deal. They look nice though

Cons:
-AI sometimes seems to need to load through AOL servers to know what is going on
-Bugs
-Glitches
-Kind of a short game

Things I would add to the game:
-Sitting. Let me sit on benches and at the bar and take in the atmosphere. The game boasted immersiveness and it is still missing some elements that would help it. I can look in the mirror but I cannot sit at the bar/restaurant and drink/eat without it being required for a quest. I know the vendor menu is to let people go in and out quickly, but add an option where the character sits there and is served to add immersiveness to the game.
-Hide head option. Lets be honest, we want to see our character's faces when looking in the mirror, the inventory, or the photo mode.
-Addition of ""attire slots"" or whatever you want to call them. Saves the look you have on and keeps it no matter what you are wearing.
-Addition of barbershops, etc. to customize our characters during the game.
-Car customization and further weapon customization, ability to make them truly ours.
-Would not mind ""mini-games"" for doing something with V's friends. *""Cousin, lets go bowling"" echos in the distance*

I have faith that CDPR will make the game a lot better, as they did with Witcher 3, people seem to forget how buggy it was. The game is definitely not finished at the moment, like 80% done and should not have been released at this stage. Should of had the ""Early Access"" tag.","Technical Stability, Performance, Overall Enjoyment"

"If you're touchy about controller stick sensitivity and response curves like me, this game is not for you. Better controller support would make this game 10/10. All of my almost 8 hours in this game has been trying to get the sensitivity decent (and yes I've tweaked every setting in the 'advanced' section too). I can get normal look sensitivity to be decent, but then ADS is way too fast. When I implement changes to make ADS decent, normal look has jerky sensitivity increases. It looks really good, and when I play it on mkb, it's excellent, but I have nerve damage that doesn't allow me to use wasd very long and need controller support.

So far, I am fully immersed! I told everyone I know that I will be going on a vacation to night city for a week straight! Beyond that, I doubt I will be able to tear myself away from this masterpiece often. It's the whole package. The driving is beautiful, gunplay is great, aesthetic is unmatched.

Cheers, see you all in Night City!","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Gameplay Immersion"
"[strike][h1] I would advise you to wait a couple of weeks or until the next major patch [/h1]

I'll start off by saying that this game is great. And it looks great, performance is far from the best, but it definitely doesn't look bad, don't really know what people were expecting. It looks like a 2020 game to me.

But, and this is a big but (eheh) i consider this game unplayable. And i'll try really hard to avoid playing it for now (something that i will probably fail to do unfortunately). The amount of times i reloaded in ""just"" 8h (actual in game time) is incredibly high. reasons being:

- Objects that are suppose to be intractable refuse to work
- Analysis mode keeps getting stuck (needs reload)
- The dodge animation triggering in stealth sections ( easy to fix with a remap and it might just be my clumsy fingers but i don't understand why you can dodge when crouched), or exiting crouch (stealth) just by bumping into stuff or because the game decided to (needs reload if i want to keep stealthy)
- Braindance showing missing stuff to interact with when i already interacted with them ( i found that i need to wait a second or two after a character as finished talking before scanning and that fixes it)
- Getting stuck on walls (literally, also needs reload) 
- Floating people, floating cars, floating assets
- Lots of sound issues, people talking over each other, sound not triggering.
- Missing assets (Searched for a gun for like 15 minutes that i knew it had to be there, finally caved, looked online and.. it should've been on the first place i looked, needed reload)
- Quest items that i can't interact even after reloading 3 times

I would ""accept all of this"" just because i really want to play this game, because as i said the game is incredible and reloading although extremely infuriating fixes [b]most[/b] stuff, but this is an rpg, and i keep thinking, ""did  messed up? was this intentional by the game? am i missing something? is this a bug? is the script broken?"" it's just unplayable, i've already had to check 2 guides online to see what was wrong (both times, it was a quest breaking bug and not my fault), and on the second time google's search results spoiled the entire quest.


Like i said the game is amazing and i will update this review in a few weeks into and amazingly positive one, but right now,
for the love of your sanity [b] WAIT [/b], usually most major stuff gets fixed on the month of release, or at least that's what i'm hoping[/strike]","Technical Stability, Gameplay Functionality"
"UPDATED REVIEW since launch

I had to come back and give my thoughts after finishing the game at launch and leaving the review below. (I still gave it a thumbs up at the time).

I have sat back and watched with indifference as CDPR released various patches, until a few weeks ago I got an itch to come back and see what changed. Can I just start by saying... I am now on my third play through since coming back and already thinking about my 4th! And I am NOT somebody that normally replays a game (outside of GTA or Elder Scrolls).

Good Points:

1) Firstly, this game is the BEST at one thing IMO. It brings the characters to life and makes you feel immersed in the setting with good dialogue, multiple choices, outcomes and options. Characters become more than bobbing heads you just want to shoot and forget about. This echos throughout the game and I can't think of any other game that does this quite so well. 

2) The small touches have had a HUGE impact, more than I could have imagined. Extra weapons, buying apartments, being able to changing your look without messing your stats etc It has made a big, big difference. 

3) The side quests are a MUST, i normally ignore side quests for the most part, but CDPR actually put a lot of effort into these. Including a back story, a good setting, dialogue from johnny and others. DO NOT skip them, they add a lot of great gameplay and immersion. 

4) I can't fault the amount of content, between Side quests, police events (can't remember the correct name, side stuff) honestly there is no reason you shouldn't have 40+ hours of content. I STILL do think that the main story line is shockingly short, and its a downer that the main character is dying, I felt the same when i found out arthur was dying in RDR2...

5) The level of lore, that you can optionally dig into, is great! It adds that Elder Scrolls level of background lore that gives the city a life and a history. 

6) The combat is decent, but TOO EASY, i want more of a challenge, and not just the option of upping the difficulty in the game to just make them bullet sponges. 

7) The NPC AI has improved, but hitting people with cars, or how they react to you sometimes, while not a big deal for me, is a bit shit. 


Bad Points

1) Without specific missions, side quests etc there is little you can do to feel apart of the city. More in this area would make a big difference. 

2) The rag doll effects and the feel when you use melee weapons doesn't feel great. Plus when you shoot people in the head etc the visual effects are repetitive (i could shoot someone strait through the left side of the head but the gaping hole would always appear on the opposite side for example. 

3) The gangs still don't seem 'alive' or different, doing the side quests makes it a bit better i guess. But still, i was hoping to get more immersion from having all these gangs. 

4) Weapon customization has improved, but is still quite limited. 

5) No car customization. 

6) Getting 'chromed up' doesn't make you look different (besides your arms).

7) Map is still a bit small, and very small when you venture outside of the city. A lot of the hinterland is oil rigs etc that could have been used to put more towns / city there.


I'm very surprised to say this, but I am still enjoying it alot right now and I will def be buying the upcoming DLC.




Original Review: 

After the buzz, I can't help but feel disappointed..

1) The main story is too short and the pace is really bad (long talking scenes followed by short game play parts).

2) Very limited amount of weapons. 

3) Customizing weapons is extremely limited.

4) It's not an RPG in a sense that you can create your characters life-path and buy homes, build a crew, and so on. It's moreso choices you have within the main story. I am on my second playthrough and I am going to do the side quests but I'm asking myself what is the point...  

5) The various gangs, hell even the city itself, it a shallow show piece with no real substance to the story, they are just different looking bad guys. 

6) (On a more personal note) I really dislike the story plots where your playing someone who is 'serious ill / dying'. Instead of feeling like your making your mark on the gameworld and creating a bad ass character, you feel obligated to just clear the bloody thing. I felt the same with Arthur Morgan in red dead 2 one i found out he was dying, it was a downer and I just felt liking clearing the story strait away. 

This game looks great, the main story is pretty good and i felt emotionally involved. But to call this some sort of open world rpg in the sense of GTA 5 or Skyrim - not a chance. I wouldn't have paid the asking price for this game if I knew all of this before hand. The main story was great, but everything else had no soul, no re-playability. 

All in all, I would recommend it, its not a 'bad game', its just not the heavy hitter its making itself out to be.","Technical Stability, Narrative Immersion, Replayability"
"Overall a fun open-world RPG, plenty of things to enjoy in the game - true, not exactly what was advertised and hyped up (not a next gen rpg for sure), but still a good solid game on its own. 
Pro:
Graphics are beautiful, quests are solid and plenty, story was well written, fighting is fun.
Negative:
Driving is bad, which is a pity as it would be great to just roam around driving. Some bugs remain but nothing game breaking, minor glitches. Annoying at times, but not a big issue.","Consumer Value, Gameplay Mechanics, Technical Stability"

"Polygon released an article stating that Cyberpunk 2077 raises the bar for open world games. And after a broken launch, years of fixes, and now, the absolute overhaul that 2.0 brings, I'm inclined to agree. Few open world titles fit that bill for me, one of which is of course Red Dead Redemption 2. I consider that an absolute gem. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't quite like RDR2, though. But that's okay. I think they both have different focuses...Though I would've loved to see the same emergent dynamic gameplay that's in RDR2 in Cyberpunk, along with the ability to interact with all of Night City's citizens. But that's okay. Like I said, different focuses.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG where you make your own character, and choose your own backstory. And not only is it a damn good RPG, but it's also a banger of a shooter with deep visceral combat where you can feel every pull of the trigger, every landed thrown knife, and every swing that you take at the enemy. Coupled with this is the spectacular and glorious backdrop of Night City which just bleeds atmosphere and cyberpunk aesthetic. You feel it every step you take, and every region you visit. It's like watching Blade Runner for the first time and taking in those wide sweeping shots of Tyrell Corporation and Los Angeles as Deckard navigates the skies in his spinner. And thank god there's plenty of reason to stay in Night City, from gigs, shops, cyber psychos, crime scenes, and many more that I'm sure you'll discover yourself.","Open World Quality, Technical Stability, RPG Elements"

"11/26/2022

Cyberpunk 2077.... What can I say    /   TLDR: The game has improved but still lacks in some areas, I would buy it, at a small discount tho.

As someone that bought the game on launch,it has gone through multiple large updates to correct the errors that the devs allowed to get through due to the Hype it created since its announcement and probably pressure from investors.

From a story perspective It has rich lore, if you take the time to read through the MRAM's that you'll find through the world.
Every since the EdgeRunnerss Update the lore has expanded even further (to even include references from the anime adaptation that Netflix created). 

World setting somewhat fits the Cyberpunk style. What I mean is that yes there is a dystopian world ruled by corrupt governments, Corporations that hold the power and lawless areas in the city ruled by the strongest gangs. But the way is put forward it makes it sound as if Night City is the only place in this fictional America that has the level of issues and corruption. Now that might change with the Phantom Liberty Update but until then this is my opinion.

Visuals are good but disappointing , unless mods are used Night City doesn't really reflect that Cyberpunk feeling, while day time is hardly used in Cybepunk visuals which make it hard to get that dystopian feeling, night time feels lacking, hardly any bright lights and heavy populations in the central area of the city, the rain feels poorly implemented and the ambiance, the feeling of dystopian future isn't really felt.
So I feel while some wish this could be reworked I hardly doubt it would happen, as it would require changing the Visuals completely. Thank God for the Modding community I'm I right?

Gameplay, while I want to like it, it feels so limiting.The AI is atrocious, yes reworks have been done to the AI but it still feels like I'm play CS:Source bots on easy mode. There isn't that feeling that I'm going against dangerous party or faction but rather a clumsy lot of bots that know how to shot or swing a katana. Even with that issue I would be fine if at least the player side movement and melee was decent, why is it that even though I'm Chromed up the ASS in upgrades but I still swing a katana like a 5 year old in a pewee baseball club, I feel like combat movement and gameplay should have been focused on more than ever. We all know we want to be that badass Assassin wielding a pistol and katana at the same time DAMIT!

Overall the game is passable, at a discount though. While the devs are making updates and changes to the game that was something they already promised before the fiasco release they had. The only reason the player count is higher than expected is because they made the right moves in the marketing department post-release by creating an anime which hit a different demographic that didn't even know the game existed, which simultaneously released the EdgeRunners update which fixed majority of the issues that Plagued the game upon release. 

Cyberpunk 2077 and its lore has so much potential but unfortunately it was cursed with the hype beast that can break or make a game. I would recommend this game still but at a small discount price $60 dollars isn't something I would pay for it now, so get it while on sale.","Consumer Value, Technical Stability, Narrative Depth"
"[h1]Cyberpunk 2077 Is My Second Life[/h1] 

Hello, hello! I'm Arif Iqbal.

I have spent a significant portion (an inordinate amount) of my real life in [b]Night City[/b] as [b]V[/b] and [b]Johnny Silverhand[/b]. At this moment, I've got Steam registering up to [i]644[/i] hours of play time. That is [i]26 days straight[/i] (if you do pedestrian maths and only divide by 24 hours). Almost a month logged into this CDPR created world! But that isn't the correct metric to use. We need to factor in sleep and other daily rituals & responsibilities (let us say... 8 hrs a piece). So, accounting for 16 hours of each day relegated to those human necessities, and dividing 644 hours by 8 hours, we come to a whopping [i]80.5 days![/i] We are pushing 3 months here! [i]That is a quarter of a year here on earth.[/i] And I can honestly say I'm a better person for it.

Why? Because Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game despite its many, many flaws. I've learned a ton about the solo mercenary life, developed my narrow decision making skills, and how to handle different sociopathic personalities. I've kept my hand and eye coordination strong, and my reaction times quick. That is what's really important here.

I mean, who cares that I've neglected my family and friends, physical fitness, diet, and spirituality? Or that I am unemployed, lost my girlfriend of 8 years, and am basically homeless (but not really... Thanks Mom!)? Not me. Instead I've got sweet, sweet V and her glistening 6 pack abs, thunder thighs, and big booty (thank you Spawn0 mods!!!). I've got Legendary guns of all types, sizes, and calibres! I've got razor sharp, designer katanas! I've got countless clothing items, accessories, designer drugs (oh, wait! they removed them, thanks 1.5 patch), and fast-as-fack cars! And last but not least, I've got countless game mods.

I think the plethora of available PC mods for this game are another great reason I've been able to spend so much time in this fictional world (other than the glaringly obvious fact that I'm using it as an escape from my real world and all its problems). There are many mods to correct the annoying and downright dumb issues that CDPR managed to incorporate into their [i]""finished""[/i] product. Everything from the incredibly important Underwear Remover mod to the [i]nice-to-have[/i] Vehicle Combat, Flashlight, and Car Modification mods. Or maybe that's backwards? Either way, the mods for Cyberpunk 2077 make the game a genuinely enjoyable experience instead of a frustrating slog-fest.

I recommend adding as many mods as you can actually. Obviously CDPR won't do it. I know, I know! What about the 1.5 patch?!? Well, it did fix some of the glaring issues with the game and added a few little bits, but at the same time it went and fucked up all my mods. I had to wait a few days for Cyber Engine Tweaks. And I'm still waiting for the Full Game Rebalance to be updated post 1.5 patch (c'mon Scissors!). I already said I don't have a real life outside of Night City.

But honestly, the game is great. It has an incredible story that is immersive, engaging, and coherent. The voice acting and character visuals are beautiful  and intriguing. I really enjoy customizing V's appearance and perfecting every detail. Also, I didn't realize until now how much I enjoy women's clothes. I mean, you're not gonna catch me on Grindr wearing my ex's panties or anyting [unless you're in my area ;) ], but I have grown an appreciation for garment fit, color matching, and accessories of the female variety. Much like dressing up a Barbie doll I'd think.

Back to the game...So, Night City is gorgeous and huge with many interesting sites to explore, hundreds of Easter Eggs to find, and more than enough Gigs and NCPD scanner hustles to complete. Also, side missions-a-plenty. And despite the silly vehicle traffic, annoying pedestrian behavior, overcrowding of NPC's causing PC performance lag and FPS drop, as well as Playstaion 2-ish distant vehicle animations, the map and most things in it are still great. Again, get those mods! Almost all of these issues have a mod to fix it or make it better. I'd buy that for a dollar!

Wait! There's more! While playing there have been many times where I found a rare Easter Egg or discovered a hidden mystery in-game and wanted to share it with real world people. So, I'll immediately jump on Brave Search or Reddit to see if anyone else has found what I found. And usually, of course they have. But, I've put so much time and OCD level effort into experiencing just about every facet that this game has to offer that there have been a few Easter Eggs or mysteries I've found that only have one mention of it online. But that is the fun of it. Like being an explorer. An explorer with a crippling case of OCD and addiction unfortunately. All the same, check out r/FF06B5 for plenty of Cyberpunk 2077 mysteries.

I could probably write a novel on this game (Maybe I should, actually?). But this review has gone on long enough. Much like my most recent game play through. And I need to play through another ending option (and possibly a hidden one? I don't remember how many there actually are). I won't spoil anything but I found one of them to be highly fun and entertaining. Most of the others are just sad (crying face). 

Alright, that's it for this review. If you haven't played this game yet, then shame on you. It is worth it. Not the greatest game ever, but it could have been. And with the right mods and future updates it may get close. You'll be playing a piece of history right here and that is what is important. We won't see a Game of the Year edition but CDPR has promised to right its wrongs and remain dedicated to patching the issues and providing some minor content additions (definitely not any DLC content, however, no matter how many times CDPR uses the term to denote two pieces of clothing additions to the game). 

This has been you're man, Stan! Join me for another day in our City of Dreams!!!","Immersion, Engagement, Longevity"
